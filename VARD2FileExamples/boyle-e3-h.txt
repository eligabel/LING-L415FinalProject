1.  BOYLE-E3-H,8E.2

The first and most general Observation is, That Electrical Bodies draw
not unless they be <normalised orig="warm'd" auto="true">warmed</normalised>; which Rule though I have now and then found
to admit of an Exception, <paren> whereof I elsewhere offer an account
, <$$paren> yet, as to the generality of common <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised>, it holds
well enough to give much countenance to our Doctrine, which teaches the
effects of Electrical Bodies to be <normalised orig="perform'd" auto="true">performed</normalised> by Corporeal Emanations.
BOYLE-E3-H,8E.3

For $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} known, that Heat, by agitating the parts of a fit
Body, <normalised orig="solicites" auto="true">solicits</normalised> it as it were to send forth its <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font>,
as is obvious in odoriferous Gums and Perfumes, which, being heated,
send forth their fragrant steams, both further and more copiously than
otherwise they would.  BOYLE-E3-H,8E.4

2.  BOYLE-E3-H,8E.5

Next, it has been <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised>, that Amber, &c. <normalised orig="warm'd" auto="true">warmed</normalised> by the fire
, does not attract so vigorously, as if it acquire an equal degree of
heat by being <normalised orig="chaf'd" auto="true">chafed</normalised> or <normalised orig="rub'd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised>: So that the modification of motion in the
internal parts, and in the Emanations of <P_9E> the Amber, may, as well
as the degree of it, contribute to the Attraction.  BOYLE-E3-H,9E.6

And my particular Observations incline me to <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>, that the effect may
oftentimes be much promoted, by employing both these ways successively ;
as I thought I manifestly found when I first <normalised orig="warm'd" auto="true">warmed</normalised> the Amber at the
fire, and presently after <normalised orig="chaf'd" auto="true">chafed</normalised> it a little upon a piece of cloth.
BOYLE-E3-H,9E.7

For then a very few <normalised orig="rubbings" auto="true">rubbing's</normalised> <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> to excite it more than many more
would otherwise have done: As if the heat of the fire had put the parts
into a general, but <normalised orig="confus'd" auto="true">confused</normalised>, agitation; to which $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas}
<normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> for the subsequent Attrition <paren> or Reciprocation of Pressure
<$$paren> to give a convenient modification in a Body whose Texture
disposes it to become vigorously Electrical.  BOYLE-E3-H,9E.8

3.  BOYLE-E3-H,9E.9

Another Observation that is made about these Bodies, is, That they
require <normalised orig="Tersion" auto="true">Torsion</normalised> as well as Attrition; BOYLE-E3-H,9E.10

and though I doubt whether the Rule be infallible, yet I deny not but
that weaker <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised> require <P_10E> to be as well <normalised orig="wip'd" auto="true">wiped</normalised> as <normalised orig="chaf'd" auto="true">chafed</normalised>;
BOYLE-E3-H,10E.11

and even good ones will have their Operation promoted by the same means.
BOYLE-E3-H,10E.12

And this is very agreeable to our Doctrine, since <normalised orig="Tersion" auto="true">Torsion</normalised>, besides
that it is, as I have sometimes manifestly known it, a kind or degree
of Attrition, frees the Surface from those <normalised orig="adherences" auto="true">adherence's</normalised> that might <normalised orig="choak" auto="true">choke</normalised>
the pores of the Amber, or at least hinder the emanation of the steams
to be so free and copious as otherwise it would be.  BOYLE-E3-H,10E.13

4.  BOYLE-E3-H,10E.14

$<normalised orig="'T" auto="true">To</normalised> $is {TEXT:'Tis} likewise <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised>, That whereas the <normalised orig="Magnetical" auto="true">Magnetically</normalised> Steams
are so <normalised orig="subtile" auto="true">subtle</normalised>, that they penetrate and perform their Operation through
all kind of Mediums hitherto known to us; Electrical Steams are like
those of some odoriferous Bodies, easily <normalised orig="check'd" auto="true">checked</normalised> in their progress, since
$<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} <normalised orig="affirm'd" auto="true">affirmed</normalised> by Learned Writers, who say they speak upon
particular Trial, that the interposition of the finest <normalised orig="Linnen" auto="true">Linen</normalised> or <normalised orig="Sarsnet" auto="true">Sarsenet</normalised>
is sufficient to hinder all the Operation of excited Amber upon a Straw
or Feather <P_11E> <normalised orig="plac'd" auto="true">placed</normalised> never so little beyond it.  BOYLE-E3-H,11E.15

5.  BOYLE-E3-H,11E.16

It has been also observed, that the effects of Electrical Attraction are
<normalised orig="weaken'd" auto="true">weakened</normalised> if the air be thick and cloudy; and especially if the <normalised orig="Southwind" auto="true">Southend</normalised>
blows: And that <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised> display their <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> more faintly by night
than by day, and more vigorously in clear weather, and when the winds
are Northerly.  All which the Learned <font> Kircherus <$$font> asserts
himself to have found true by experience; <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that those bodies
that are but faintly drawn when the weather is clear, will not, when
$<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} thick and cloudy, be at all moved.  BOYLE-E3-H,11E.17

6.  BOYLE-E3-H,11E.18

We have also observed, That divers Concretes, that are notably Electrical,
do abound in an effluviable matter <paren> if I may so call it <$$paren>
which is capable of being manifestly evaporated by heat and rubbing.
BOYLE-E3-H,11E.19

Thus we see, that most Resinous Gums, that draw light bodies, do also,
being moderately solicited by heat, <paren> whether this be excited by
the fire, or by Attrition or Contusion <$$paren> <P_12E> emit steams.
BOYLE-E3-H,12E.20

And in pieces of <font> Sulphur <$$font> conveniently shaped, I found
upon due Attrition a <normalised orig="Sulphureous" auto="true">Sulphurous</normalised> stink.  BOYLE-E3-H,12E.21

And that piece of Amber which I most employ, being somewhat large and
very well <normalised orig="polish'd" auto="true">polished</normalised>, will, being <normalised orig="rub'd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised> upon a piece of woollen cloth,
emit steams, which the nostrils themselves may perceive; BOYLE-E3-H,12E.22

and they sometimes seem to me not unlike those that I took notice of,
when I kept in my mouth a drop or two of the diluted Tincture <paren>
or Solution of the finer parts <$$paren> of Amber made with Spirit of
Wine, or of <normalised orig="Sal" auto="true">Sale</normalised> <normalised orig="Armoniac" auto="true">Ammoniac</normalised>.  BOYLE-E3-H,12E.23

7.  BOYLE-E3-H,12E.24

It agrees very well with what has been said of the corporeal Emanations
of Amber, that its attractive power will continue some time after it
has been once excited.  BOYLE-E3-H,12E.25

For the Attrition having <normalised orig="caus'd" auto="true">cause</normalised> an intestine commotion in the parts of the
Concrete, the heat or warmth that is thereby excited ought not to cease,
as soon as ever the rubbing is over, but to continue capable of emitting
<P_13E> <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font> for some time afterwards, which will
be longer or shorter according to the goodness of the Electric, and the
degree of the Antecedent commotion: which <normalised orig="joyn'd" auto="true">joined</normalised> together may sometimes
make the effect considerable, <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that in a warm day, about noon,
I did with a certain body, not much, if at all, bigger than a Pea, but
very vigorously attractive, move to and fro a Steel Needle freely <normalised orig="poysed" auto="true">poised</normalised>,
about three minutes <paren> or the twentieth part of an hour <$$paren>
after I had left off rubbing the <normalised orig="Attrahent" auto="true">Adherent</normalised>.  BOYLE-E3-H,13E.26

8.  BOYLE-E3-H,13E.27

That it may not seem impossible, that Electrical <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font>
should be able to insinuate themselves into the pores of many other
bodies, I shall <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>, that I found them <normalised orig="subtile" auto="true">subtle</normalised> enough to attract not
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Spirit of Wine, but that of {HELSINKI:'of'_missing} the fluid
aggregate of Corpuscles we call <normalised orig="Smoak" auto="true">Smoke</normalised>.  BOYLE-E3-H,13E.28

For having well lighted a Wax-taper, which I <normalised orig="preferr'd" auto="true">preferred</normalised> to a common Candle
to avoid the stink of the snuff, I blew out the flame; BOYLE-E3-H,13E.29

and, when the <normalised orig="smoak" auto="true">smoke</normalised> <P_14E> ascended in a slender stream, held, at
a convenient distance from it, an excited piece of Amber or a chafed
Diamond, which would manifestly make the ascending <normalised orig="smoak" auto="true">smoke</normalised> deviate from its
former line, and turn aside, to beat, as it were, against the Electric ,
which, if it were vigorous, would act at a considerable distance, and
seemed to <normalised orig="smoak" auto="true">smoke</normalised> for a pretty while together.  BOYLE-E3-H,14E.30

9.  BOYLE-E3-H,14E.31

That $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} not in any peculiar Sympathy between an Electric
and a body whereon it operates, that {on} Electrical Attraction depends,
seems the more probable, because Amber, for instance, does not attract
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> one determinate sort of bodies, as the <normalised orig="Loadstone" auto="true">Lodestone</normalised> does Iron, and
those bodies wherein it abounds; BOYLE-E3-H,14E.32

but as far as I have yet tried, it draws indifferently all bodies
whatsoever, being <normalised orig="plac'd" auto="true">placed</normalised> within a due distance from it, <paren> as my
choicest piece of Amber draws not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Sand and Mineral Powders, but
Filings of Steel and Copper, and beaten Gold it self <$$paren> <P_15E>
provided they be minute or light enough, except perhaps it be fire:
BOYLE-E3-H,15E.33

I employ the word <font> perhaps <$$font>, because I am not yet so clear
in this point.  BOYLE-E3-H,15E.34

For having applied a strong Electric at a convenient distance to
small fragments of ignited matter, they were readily enough attracted,
BOYLE-E3-H,15E.35

and <normalised orig="shin'd" auto="true">shined</normalised>, whilst they were sticking to the body that had drawn them:
BOYLE-E3-H,15E.36

But when I <normalised orig="look'd" auto="true">looked</normalised> attentively upon them, I found the shining sparks to be,
as it were, <normalised orig="cloath'd" auto="true">clothed</normalised> with light ashes, which, in spite of my diligence,
had been already <normalised orig="form'd" auto="true">formed</normalised> about the attracted Corpuscles , upon the expiring
of a good part of the fire; so that it <normalised orig="remain'd" auto="true">remained</normalised> somewhat doubtful to
me, whether the ignited Corpuscles, whilst they were totally such, were
attracted; or whether the immediate objects of the Attraction were not
the new <normalised orig="form'd" auto="true">formed</normalised> ashes, which carried up with them those yet <normalised orig="unextinguished" auto="true">inextinguishable</normalised>
parts of fire, that <normalised orig="chanc'd" auto="true">chanced</normalised> to be <normalised orig="lodg'd" auto="true">lodged</normalised> in them.  BOYLE-E3-H,15E.37

But, as for flame, our <normalised orig="Countreyman" auto="true">Countryman</normalised> <P_16E> <font> Gilbert <$$font>
delivers as his Experiment, That an Electric though duly excited and
applied, will not move the flame of the slenderest Candle.  Which some
will think not so <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to be well tried with common <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised>, as
Amber, hard Wax, Sulphur, and the like unctuous Concretes, that very
easily take fire: BOYLE-E3-H,16E.38

Therefore I chose to make my Trial, with a rough Diamond extraordinarily
attractive, which I could, without injuring it, hold as near as I <normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised>
to the flame of a Candle or Taper; BOYLE-E3-H,16E.39

and though I was not <normalised orig="satisfi'd" auto="true">satisfied</normalised> that it did either attract the flame,
as it visibly did the <normalised orig="smoak" auto="true">smoke</normalised>, or manifestly agitate it; yet granting
that <font> Gilbert's <$$font> Assertion will constantly hold true,
and so, that flame is to be excepted from the general Rule, yet
this exception may well comport with the <font> Hypothesis <$$font>
hitherto <normalised orig="countenanc'd" auto="true">countenanced</normalised>, since it may be said, as $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} ,
if I mistake not, by <font> Kirkerus <$$font>, that the heat of the
flame dissipates the <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font>, by whose means the
Attraction <P_17E> should be <normalised orig="perform'd" auto="true">performed</normalised>.  To which I shall <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised>, that
possibly the Celerity of the motion of the Flame upwards, may render it
very difficult for the Electrical Emanations to divert the Flame from
its Course.  BOYLE-E3-H,17E.40

10.  BOYLE-E3-H,17E.41

We have found by Experiment, That a vigorous and well excited piece of
Amber will draw, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> the powder of Amber, but less minute fragments
of it.  BOYLE-E3-H,17E.42

And as in many cases one contrary directs to another, so this Trial
suggested a further, which, in case of good success, would probably
argue, that in Electrical Attraction not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font>
are emitted by the Electrical body, but these <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font>
fasten upon the body to be drawn, and that in such a way, that the
intervening viscous strings, which may be supposed to be made up of those
cohering <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font>, are, when their agitation ceases,
contracted or made to shrink inwards towards both ends, almost as a
highly <normalised orig="strech'd" auto="true">stretch</normalised> Lute-string does when $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} permitted to
retreat into <P_18E> shorter Dimensions.  BOYLE-E3-H,18E.43

But the Conjecture it self was much more <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to be made than the
Experiment requisite to examine it.  BOYLE-E3-H,18E.44

For we found it no <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> matter to suspend an Electric, great and vigorous
enough, in such a manner, that it might, whilst suspended, be excited,
and be so nicely poised, that so faint a force as that <normalised orig="wherewith" auto="true">whereat</normalised> it
attracts light bodies should be able to procure a Local Motion to the
whole Body it self.  BOYLE-E3-H,18E.45

But after some fruitless attempts with other <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised>, I had recourse
to the very vigorous piece of <normalised orig="polish'd" auto="true">polished</normalised> Amber, formerly <normalised orig="mention'd" auto="true">mentioned</normalised>,
BOYLE-E3-H,18E.46

and when we had with the help of a little Wax suspended it by a silken
thread, we chafed very well one of the blunt edges of it upon a kind
of large Pin-cushion <normalised orig="cover'd" auto="true">covered</normalised> with a course and black woollen stuff,
BOYLE-E3-H,18E.47

and then brought the Electric, as soon as we could, to settle
notwithstanding its hanging freely at the bottom of the string.
BOYLE-E3-H,18E.48

This course of rubbing on the edge of the Amber we <normalised orig="pitch'd" auto="true">pitched</normalised> <P_19E>
upon for more than one reason; BOYLE-E3-H,19E.49

for if we had chafed the flat side, the Amber could not have approached
the body it had been <normalised orig="rub'd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised> on without making a change of place in the
whole Electric, and, which is worse, without making it move <paren>
contrary to the nature of heavy bodies <$$paren> somewhat upwards; whereas
the Amber having, by reason of its suspension, its parts <normalised orig="counterpoised" auto="true">counterpoise</normalised>
by one another; to make the excited edge approach to another body, that
edge needed not at all ascend, but <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> be moved horizontally, to which
way of moving the gravity of the Electric <paren> which the string kept
from moving downwards <$$paren> could be but little or no <normalised orig="hinderance" auto="true">hindrance</normalised>.
BOYLE-E3-H,19E.50

And agreeably to this we found, that if, as soon as the suspended and well
<normalised orig="rubb'd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised> Electric was brought to settle freely, we applied to the chafed
edge, but without touching it, the lately <normalised orig="mention'd" auto="true">mentioned</normalised> Cushion, which, by
reason of its rough <font> <normalised orig="Superficies" auto="true">Supervises</normalised> <$$font> and porosity , was fit
for the Electrical <P_20E> <font> <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised> <$$font> to fasten upon, the
edge would manifestly be drawn aside by the Cushion steadily held, and
if this were slowly removed, would follow it a good way; BOYLE-E3-H,20E.51

and when this body no longer <normalised orig="detain'd" auto="true">detained</normalised> it, would return to the posture
wherein it had settled before.  BOYLE-E3-H,20E.52

And this power of approaching the Cushion by <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of the operation of
its own steams, was so durable in our vigorous piece of Amber, that by
once chafing it, I was able to make it follow the Cushion no less than
ten or eleven times.  BOYLE-E3-H,20E.53

Whether from such Experiments one may argue, that $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis}
but, as $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $were {TEXT:'twere}, by accident that Amber attracts another
body, and not this the Amber; and whether these ought to make us question,
if <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised> may with so much propriety, as has been hitherto generally
supposed, be said to <font> Attract <$$font>, are doubts that my Design
does not here oblige me to examine.  BOYLE-E3-H,20E.54

Some other <font> <normalised orig="Phaenomena" auto="true">Phenomenon</normalised> <$$font> might be added of the same Tendency
with <P_21E> those already <normalised orig="mention'd" auto="true">mentioned</normalised>, <paren> as the advantage that
Electrical Bodies usually get by having well <normalised orig="polish'd" auto="true">polished</normalised> or at least smooth
Surfaces, <$$paren> BOYLE-E3-H,21E.55

but the Title of this Paper promising some <font> Experiments <$$font>
about the <font> Production <$$font> of Electricity, I must not omit
to recite, how I have been sometimes able to produce or destroy this
Quality in certain bodies, by means of alterations, that <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised> not
to be other than Mechanical.  BOYLE-E3-H,21E.56

And first, having with a very mild heat slowly evaporated about a fourth
part of good Turpentine, I found, that the remaining body would not,
when cold, continue a Liquor, but <normalised orig="harden'd" auto="true">hardened</normalised> into a transparent Gum almost
like Amber, which, as I <normalised orig="look'd" auto="true">looked</normalised> for, proved Electrical.  BOYLE-E3-H,21E.60

Secondly, by mixing two such liquid Bodies as <font> Petroleum <$$font>
and strong Spirit of Nitre in a certain proportion, and then distilling
them till there remained a dry mass, I <normalised orig="obtain'd" auto="true">obtained</normalised> a brittle substance as
black as Jet; and whose <normalised orig="Superficies" auto="true">Supervises</normalised> <paren> where it was contiguous
to the Retort <$$paren> was <normalised orig="glossie" auto="true">glossy</normalised> like that Mineral when polished;
BOYLE-E3-H,22E.65

and as I expected I found it also to resemble Jet, in being endowed with
an Electrical Faculty.  BOYLE-E3-H,22E.66

<$$heading>

Thirdly, Having burnt Antimony to ashes, and of those ashes, without
any addition, made a transparent Glass, I found, that, when <normalised orig="rubb'd" auto="true">rubbed</normalised>, as
Electrical Bodies ought to be to excite them, it <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised> my expectation,
by manifesting a not inconsiderable Electricity.  BOYLE-E3-H,22E.70

And this is the worthier of notice, because, that <font> as <$$font>
a <P_23E> <normalised orig="Vitrum" auto="true">Veteran</normalised> <normalised orig="Antimonii" auto="true">Antimony</normalised>, that is said to be purer than ordinary,
may be made of the <font> <normalised orig="Regulus" auto="true">Regales</normalised> <$$font> of the same Mineral, in whose
preparation you know a great part of the Antimonial Sulphur is separated
and left among the <normalised orig="Scoriae" auto="true">Score</normalised>; <font> so <$$font> Glass of Antimony made
without additament, may easily, as experience has <normalised orig="inform'd" auto="true">informed</normalised> us, be in
part reduced to a <font> <normalised orig="Regulus" auto="true">Regales</normalised> <$$font>, <paren> a Body not <normalised orig="reckon'd" auto="true">reckoned</normalised>
amongst Electrical ones.  <$$paren> BOYLE-E3-H,23E.71

And that you may not think, that $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> some peculiar
and <normalised orig="fixt" auto="true">fixed</normalised> part of the Antimony that is capable of <font> Vitrification
<$$font>, let me assure you, that even with the other part that is wont
to <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised> away, <paren> namely the Flowers <$$paren> an Antimonial Glass
may without an addition of other Ingredients be made.  BOYLE-E3-H,23E.72

Fourthly, The mention of a Vitrified Body brings into my mind,
that I more than once made some Glass of Lead per se, <paren> which
<P_24E> I found not very <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> work <$$paren> that also was not wholly
destitute of an Electrical <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>, though it had but a very languid one.
BOYLE-E3-H,24E.76

And it is not here to be <normalised orig="overlook'd" auto="true">overlooked</normalised>, that this Glass might easily be
brought to afford again malleable Lead, which was never <normalised orig="reckon'd" auto="true">reckoned</normalised>, that
I know of, among Electrical Bodies.  BOYLE-E3-H,24E.77

<normalised orig="EXPER" auto="true">EXPIRE</normalised>. V.  BOYLE-E3-H,24E.79

<$$heading>

<normalised orig="Fifthly" auto="true">Softly</normalised>, Having taken some Amber, and warily <normalised orig="distill'd" auto="true">distilled</normalised> it, not with Sand,
or <normalised orig="powder'd" auto="true">powdered</normalised> Brick, or some such additament as <normalised orig="Chymists" auto="true">Chemists</normalised> are wont to use,
for fear it should <normalised orig="boyl" auto="true">boil</normalised> over or break their Vessels; but by it self, that
I might have an <normalised orig="unmixed" auto="true">unmasked</normalised> <normalised orig="Caput" auto="true">Caped</normalised> <normalised orig="mortuum" auto="true">morton</normalised>; Having made this Distillation,
I say, and continued it till it had afforded a good proportion of
phlegm, Spirit, Volatile Salt, and <normalised orig="Oyl" auto="true">Oil</normalised>, the Retort was warily broken,
BOYLE-E3-H,24E.81

and the remaining matter was taken out in a lump, which, though it had
quite lost its colour being <P_25E> burnt quite black, and though it were
grown strangely brittle in comparison of Amber, so that they who believe
the <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of attracting light Bodies to flow from the substantial form
of Amber, would not expect it in a Body so changed and deprived of its
noblest parts: Yet this <normalised orig="Caput" auto="true">Caped</normalised> <normalised orig="mortuum" auto="true">morton</normalised> was so far from having lost its
Electrical Faculty, that it seemed to attract more vigorously than
Amber it self is wont to do before it be committed to Distillation.
BOYLE-E3-H,25E.82

And from the foregoing Instances afforded us by the Glass of Antimony,
we may learn, that when the form of a Body seems to be destroyed by
a fiery <font> Analysis <$$font> that dissipates the parts of it, the
remaining substance may yet be endowed with Electricity, as the <normalised orig="Caput" auto="true">Caped</normalised>
<normalised orig="mortuum" auto="true">morton</normalised> of Amber may acquire it; as in the case of the Glass of Antimony
made of the <font> <normalised orig="Calx" auto="true">Calyx</normalised> <$$font> and of the Flowers.  BOYLE-E3-H,25E.83

And from the second Example abovementioned, and from common Glass which
is Electrical, we may also <P_26E> learn, that Bodies that are neither
of them apart observed to be endowed with Electricity, may have that
<normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> result in the compounded substance that they constitute, though
it be but a factitious Body.  BOYLE-E3-H,26E.84

To the foregoing Experiments, whose success is wont to be uniform enough,
I shall <normalised orig="adde" auto="true">add</normalised> the Recital of a surprising <font> <normalised orig="Phaenomenon" auto="true">Phenomenon</normalised> <$$font>,
which, though not constant, may help to make it probable, that Electrical
Attractions need not be <normalised orig="suppos'd" auto="true">supposed</normalised> still to proceed from the substantial,
or even from the essential Form of the <normalised orig="Attrahent" auto="true">Adherent</normalised>; but may be the effects
of unheeded, and, as it were, fortuitous Causes.  BOYLE-E3-H,26E.85

And however, I dare not suppress so strange an Observation,
BOYLE-E3-H,26E.86

and therefore shall relate that which I had the luck to make of an odd
sort of Electrical Attraction <paren> as it <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised>, <$$paren> not taken
notice of <paren> that I know of <$$paren> by any either Naturalist or
other Writer, BOYLE-E3-H,26E.87

and it is this.  BOYLE-E3-H,26E.88

<normalised orig="EXPER" auto="true">EXPIRE</normalised>. VI.  BOYLE-E3-H,27E.91

<$$heading>

That false Locks <paren> as they call them <$$paren> of some Hair,
being by curling or otherwise brought to a certain degree of <normalised orig="driness" auto="true">dryness</normalised>,
or of stiffness, will be attracted by the flesh of some persons, or seem
to apply themselves to it, as Hair is wont to do to Amber or Jet excited
by rubbing.  Of this I had a Proof in such Locks worn by two very Fair
Ladies that you know.  BOYLE-E3-H,27E.93

For at some times I observed, that they could not keep their Locks
from flying to their Cheeks, and <paren> though neither of them made
any use, or had any need of Painting <$$paren> from sticking there.
BOYLE-E3-H,27E.94

When one of these Beauties first <normalised orig="shew'd" auto="true">showed</normalised> me this Experiment, I <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> it
into a <normalised orig="Complemental" auto="true">Complementary</normalised> Raillery, as suspecting there might be some trick
in it, though I after saw the same thing happen to the others Locks too.
BOYLE-E3-H,27E.95

But as she is no ordinary <font> <normalised orig="Virtuosa" auto="true">Virtuoso</normalised> <$$font>, she very <P_28E>
ingeniously <normalised orig="remov'd" auto="true">removed</normalised> my suspicions, BOYLE-E3-H,28E.96

and <paren> as I requested <$$paren> gave me leave to <normalised orig="satisfie" auto="true">satisfy</normalised> my self
further, by desiring her to hold her warm hand at a convenient distance
from one of those Locks taken off and held in the air.  BOYLE-E3-H,28E.97

For as soon as she did this, the lower end of the Lock, which was free,
applied it self presently to her hand: which <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> the more strange,
because so great a multitude of Hair would not have been easily attracted
by an ordinary Electrical Body, that had not been considerably large,
or extraordinarily vigorous.  BOYLE-E3-H,28E.98

This repeated Observation put me upon inquiring among some other young
Ladies, whether they had observed any such like thing, BOYLE-E3-H,28E.99

but I found little satisfaction to my Question, except from one of
them eminent for being ingenious, who told me, that sometimes she had
met with these troublesome Locks; but that all she could tell me of
the Circumstances, which I would have been <normalised orig="inform'd" auto="true">informed</normalised> about, was, that
they <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> to her <P_29E> to <normalised orig="flye" auto="true">fly</normalised> most to her Cheeks when they had
been put into a somewhat stiff <normalised orig="Curle" auto="true">Curl</normalised>, and when the Weather was frosty.
BOYLE-E3-H,29E.100

Some years after the making the Experiments about the Production of <font>
Electricity <$$font>, having a desire to try, whether in the Attractions
made by Amber, the motions excited by the air had a considerable Interest
, or whether the Effect were not due rather to the Emission and Retraction
of <normalised orig="Effluvia" auto="true">Evolve</normalised>, which being of a viscous nature may consist of Particles
either <normalised orig="branch'd" auto="true">branched</normalised> or <normalised orig="hookt" auto="true">hooked</normalised>, or otherwise fit for some kind of Cohesion,
and capable of being <normalised orig="stretch'd" auto="true">stretched</normalised>, and of shrinking again, as Leather Thongs
are: To examine this, I say, I thought the fittest way, if $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $were
{TEXT:'twere} practicable, would be, to try, whether Amber would draw
a light Body in a Glass whence the air was <normalised orig="pumpt" auto="true">pumped</normalised> out.  BOYLE-E3-H,29E.101

And <font> though <$$font> the Trial of this <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> very difficult to
make, and we were somewhat discouraged by our first attempt, wherein the
weight of the ambient air broke our Receiver, which chanced to prove
too weak, when the internal air had been with extraordinary diligence
<normalised orig="pumpt" auto="true">pumped</normalised> out; <font> yet <$$font> having a vigorous piece of Amber, which
I had <normalised orig="caus'd" auto="true">cause</normalised> to be purposely <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> and <normalised orig="polish'd" auto="true">polished</normalised> <P_30E> for Electrical
Experiments, I afterwards repeated the Trial, BOYLE-E3-H,30E.102

and found, that in warm Weather it would retain a manifest power of
attracting for several minutes <paren> for it stirred a <normalised orig="pois'd" auto="true">poised</normalised> Needle
after above 1$$4 of an hour <$$paren> after we had done rubbing it.  Upon
which encouragement we suspended it, being first well chafed, in a Glass
Receiver that was not great, just over a light Body; BOYLE-E3-H,30E.103

and making haste with our Air-Pump to exhaust the Glass, when the Air
was withdrawn, we did by a Contrivance let down the suspended Amber till
it came very near the Straw or Feather, BOYLE-E3-H,30E.104

and perceived, as we expected, that in some Trials, upon the least Contact
it would lift it up; and in others, for we repeated the Experiment,
the Amber would raise it without touching it, that is, would attract it.
BOYLE-E3-H,30E.105

You will probably be the less <normalised orig="dispos'd" auto="true">disposed</normalised> to believe, That Electrical
Attractions must proceed from the Substantial Forms of the <normalised orig="Attrahents" auto="true">Adherents</normalised>
, or from the <normalised orig="Predominacy" auto="true">Pardoning</normalised> of this or that <normalised orig="Chymical" auto="true">Chemical</normalised> Principle in them
, if I acquaint you with some odd Trials wherein the Attraction of
light Bodies <P_31E> <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> to depend upon very small circumstances.
BOYLE-E3-H,31E.106

And though forbearing at present, to offer you my thoughts about the
cause of these surprising <font> <normalised orig="Phaenomena" auto="true">Phenomenon</normalised> <$$font>, I propose it <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised>
as a <normalised orig="Probleme" auto="true">Problem</normalised> to your self and your curious Friends, BOYLE-E3-H,31E.107

yet the main circumstances seeming to be of a Mechanical Nature, the
recital of my Trials will not be impertinent to the Design and Subject
of this Paper.  BOYLE-E3-H,31E.108

<heading>

<normalised orig="EXPER" auto="true">EXPIRE</normalised>. VII.  BOYLE-E3-H,31E.110

<$$heading>

I Took then a large and vigorous piece of Amber conveniently shaped
for my purpose, and a downy feather, such as grows upon the Bodies,
not Wings or Tails of a somewhat large Chicken: BOYLE-E3-H,31E.112

Then having moderately excited the <normalised orig="Electrick" auto="true">Electric</normalised>, I held the Amber so near
it, that the neighbouring part of the feather was drawn by it and stuck
fast to it; BOYLE-E3-H,31E.113

but the remoter parts continued in their former posture.
BOYLE-E3-H,31E.114

This done, I <normalised orig="applyed" auto="true">applied</normalised> my fore-finger to these erected <P_32E> downy
feathers, BOYLE-E3-H,32E.115

and immediately, as I expected, they left their <normalised orig="preceeding" auto="true">proceeding</normalised> posture,
BOYLE-E3-H,32E.116

and applied themselves to it as if it had been an Electrical Body.
BOYLE-E3-H,32E.117

And whether I offered to them my nail, or the pulpy part of my finger,
or held my finger towards the right hand or the left, or directly over,
these downy feathers that were near the little Quill did nimbly, and,
for ought <normalised orig="appear'd" auto="true">appeared</normalised>, equally turn themselves towards it, and fasten
themselves to it.  BOYLE-E3-H,32E.118

And to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> that the steams that issued out of so warm a Body as my
finger were not necessary to attract <paren> as men speak <$$paren>
the abovementioned feathers, instead of my finger, I applied to them,
after the same manner, a little Cylindrical Instrument of Silver, to which
they bowed and fastened themselves as they had done to my finger , though
the tip of this Instrument were presented to them in several postures.
BOYLE-E3-H,32E.119

The like success I had with the end of an Iron Key, and the like also
with a cold piece of <normalised orig="polish'd" auto="true">polished</normalised> black Marble; BOYLE-E3-H,32E.120

and sometimes <P_33E> the feathers did so readily and strongly fasten
themselves to these extraneous and <normalised orig="unexcited" auto="true">unsuited</normalised> Bodies, that I have been
able <paren> though not easily <$$paren> to make one of them draw the
feather from the Amber it self.  BOYLE-E3-H,33E.121

But it is diligently to be <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised>, that this unusual attraction
happened <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> whilst the electrical operation of the excited Amber
continued strong enough to sustain the feathers.  BOYLE-E3-H,33E.122

For afterwards, neither the approach of my finger, nor that of the
other bodies, would make the downy feathers change their posture.
BOYLE-E3-H,33E.123

Yet as soon as ever the Amber was by a light <normalised orig="affriction" auto="true">appreciation</normalised> excited again,
the feather would be disposed to apply it self again to the abovementioned
Bodies.  BOYLE-E3-H,33E.124

And lest there should be any peculiarity in that particular feather,
I made the Trials with others <paren> provided they were not long enough
to exceed the sphere of activity of the Amber <$$paren> BOYLE-E3-H,33E.125

and found the Experiment to answer my expectation.  BOYLE-E3-H,33E.126

<P_34E>

I made the Experiment also at differing times, and with some months
, if not rather years, of interval, but with the like success.
BOYLE-E3-H,34E.128

And lest you should think these <font> <normalised orig="Phaenomena" auto="true">Phenomenon</normalised> <$$font> proceed from
some peculiarity in the piece of Amber I employed, I shall add, that I
found uniformity enough in the success, when, in the place of Amber ,
I substituted another <normalised orig="Electrick" auto="true">Electric</normalised>, and particularly a smooth mass of
melted Brimstone.  BOYLE-E3-H,34E.129

These are the <font> <normalised orig="Phaenomena" auto="true">Phenomenon</normalised> <$$font> I thought fit to mention at
present of this unusual way of drawing light bodies, BOYLE-E3-H,34E.130

and with this Experiment I should conclude my Notes about Electricity,
but that I think it will not be amiss before I take leave of this Subject
, to give this Advertisement, That the event of Electrical Experiments
is not always so certain as that of many others, being sometimes much
varied by seemingly slight circumstances, and now and then by some that
are altogether <normalised orig="over-look'd" auto="true">over-looked</normalised>.  BOYLE-E3-H,34E.131

This Observation may receive credit from some of <P_35E> the particulars
above recited <paren> especially concerning the interest of the weather
, &c. in Electrical <font> <normalised orig="Phaenomena" auto="true">Phenomenon</normalised> <$$font>.  <$$paren>
BOYLE-E3-H,35E.132

But now I shall add, that, not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> there may happen some variations
in the success of Trials made with Electrical Bodies, but that it is
not so certain as many think, whether some particular Bodies be or be
not Electrical.  BOYLE-E3-H,35E.133

For the inquisitive <font> Kircherus <$$font> reckons <normalised orig="Crystall" auto="true">Crystal</normalised> among those
Gems to whom Nature has <normalised orig="denyed" auto="true">denied</normalised> the attractive power we are speaking of;
BOYLE-E3-H,35E.134

and yet I remember not, that, among all the trials I have made with
native <normalised orig="Crystall" auto="true">Crystal</normalised>, I have found any that was destitute of the power he
refuses them.  BOYLE-E3-H,35E.135

Also a late most learned Writer reciting the <normalised orig="Electricks" auto="true">Electrics</normalised>, <normalised orig="reckon'd" auto="true">reckoned</normalised> up by
our industrious Countryman <font> Gilbert <$$font>, and increasing their
number by some observed by himself, <paren> to which I shall now add,
besides white <normalised orig="Saphyrs" auto="true">Sapphires</normalised>, and white English Amethysts, the almost Diaphanous
spar of Lead Ore <$$paren> denies Electricity to a couple of transparent
Gems, the <normalised orig="Cornelion" auto="true">Carnelian</normalised> and the <normalised orig="Emrald" auto="true">Emerald</normalised>.  BOYLE-E3-H,35E.136

And I do the less wonder he should do so to the former, because I have
my self in vain tried to make any attraction with a piece of <normalised orig="Cornelion" auto="true">Carnelian</normalised>
so large and fair, that $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas} kept for a rarity;
BOYLE-E3-H,35E.137

and yet with divers other fine <normalised orig="Cornelions" auto="true">Carnelians</normalised> I have been able to attract some
light bodies very manifestly, <P_36E> if not briskly; BOYLE-E3-H,36E.138

and I usually wear a <normalised orig="Cornelian" auto="true">Carnelian</normalised> Ring, that is richly enough endowed
with Electricity.  BOYLE-E3-H,36E.139

But as for <normalised orig="Emralds" auto="true">Emeralds</normalised>, as I thought it strange that Nature should have
denied them a Quality she has granted to so many other Diaphanous Gems ,
and even to Crystal, so I thought the assertion deserved an <font> <normalised orig="Examen" auto="true">Examine</normalised>
<$$font>, upon which I concluded, that at least it does not universally
and constantly hold true.  BOYLE-E3-H,36E.140

I had indeed seen in a Ring a Stone of price and great lustre, which ,
though green, I found to be, <paren> as I <normalised orig="guess'd" auto="true">guessed</normalised> it would prove <$$paren>
vigorously enough Electrical.  BOYLE-E3-H,36E.141

But this Experiment, though seemingly conclusive, I did not look upon
as a fair trial, because the Stone was not a true <normalised orig="Emrald" auto="true">Emerald</normalised>, but, which is
rare, a green <normalised orig="Saphir" auto="true">Sapphire</normalised>.  BOYLE-E3-H,36E.142

And I learned by inquiry of the skillful Jeweller that cut it, that
it was so far from having the softness of an <normalised orig="Emrald" auto="true">Emerald</normalised>, that he found it
harder than blew <normalised orig="Saphyrs" auto="true">Sapphires</normalised> themselves, which yet are Gems of great hardness,
and by some reputed second to none, but Diamonds.  BOYLE-E3-H,36E.143

Without therefore concluding any thing from this Experiment, save that,
if the assertion I was to <normalised orig="examin" auto="true">examine</normalised> were true, the want of an Electrical
faculty might be thought a Concomitant rather of the peculiar Texture
of the <normalised orig="Emrald" auto="true">Emerald</normalised> than of its green colour, I proceeded <P_37E> to make
trial with three or four <normalised orig="Emralds" auto="true">Emeralds</normalised>, whose being true was not doubted,
BOYLE-E3-H,37E.144

and found them all somewhat, though not equally, <normalised orig="endow'd" auto="true">endowed</normalised> with Electricity,
which I found to be yet more considerable in an <normalised orig="Emrald" auto="true">Emerald</normalised> of my own, whose
colour was so excellent, that by skilful persons $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas}
<normalised orig="look'd" auto="true">looked</normalised> on as a rarity.  BOYLE-E3-H,37E.145

And though, by this success of my inquiry, I perceived I could not, as
else I might have done, <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> the Curious a new way of judging of true
and false <normalised orig="Emralds" auto="true">Emeralds</normalised>, yet the like way may be, though not always certain
, yet oftentimes of use, in the estimating whether Diamonds be true or
{HELSINKI:of} counterfeit, especially, if, being set in Rings, the surest
way of trying them $can $not {TEXT:cannot} conveniently be employed.
BOYLE-E3-H,37E.146

For whereas Glass, though it have some Electricity, seems, as far as I
have observed, to have but a faint one, there are often found Diamonds
that have a very vigorous one.  BOYLE-E3-H,37E.147

And I do not remember I met with any <normalised orig="Electrick" auto="true">Electric</normalised> of the same bulk, that
was more vigorous than a rough Diamond I have, which is the same that
I formerly mentioned to have moved a Needle above three minutes after
I had ceased to chafe it.  BOYLE-E3-H,37E.148

And this brings to my mind, that it has been observed, that Diamonds draw
better whilst rough, than they do after they are cut and <P_38E> <normalised orig="polish'd" auto="true">polished</normalised>;
which seeming to contradict what has been observed by others and by us
also, that Amber, for instance, attracts more vigorously if the surface
be made very smooth than otherwise, it induces me to conjecture, that,
if this Observation about Diamonds be true, as some of my trials have
now and then inclined me to think it, and if it do not in some cases
considerably depend upon the loss of the <paren> Electrical <$$paren>
Substance of the Stone, by its being cut and ground, the Reason may
possibly be, that the great <normalised orig="rapidness" auto="true">rubdowns</normalised> with which the Wheels that serve
to cut and polish Diamonds must be <normalised orig="mov'd" auto="true">moved</normalised>, does excite a great degree
of heat, <paren> which the senses may easily discover <$$paren> in the
Stone, and by that and the strong concussion it makes of its parts,
may force it to spend its effluviable matter, if I may so call it,
so plentifully, that the Stone may be <normalised orig="impoverish'd" auto="true">impoverished</normalised> and perhaps also,
on the account of some little change in its Texture, be <normalised orig="rendred" auto="true">rendered</normalised> <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>
disposed to emit those <font> <normalised orig="effluvia" auto="true">evolve</normalised> <$$font> that are Instruments of
Electrical Attraction.  BOYLE-E3-H,38E.149

But as I willingly leave the matter of Fact to further Trial, so
I do the Cause of it, in case it prove true, to farther Inquiry.
