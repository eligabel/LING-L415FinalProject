<P_1.1,165>

With the restoration of the king a spirit of extravagant joy being
spread over the nation, that brought on with it the throwing off the
very professions of virtue and piety: all ended in entertainments
and drunkenness, which overran <P_1.1,166> the three kingdoms
to such a degree, that it very much corrupted all their morals.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.2

Under the colour of drinking the king's health, there were great disorders
and much riot every where: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.3

and the pretences to religion, both in those of the hypocritical sort,
and of the more honest but no less pernicious enthusiasts, gave great
advantages, as well as they furnished much matter, to the profane mockers
at all true piety.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.4

Those who had been concerned in the former transactions thought they could
not redeem themselves from the censures and jealousies that these brought
on them by any method that was more sure and more easy, than by going in
to the stream, and laughing at all religion, telling or making stories
to expose both themselves and their party as impious and ridiculous.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.5

The king was then thirty years of age, and, as might have been
supposed, past the <normalised orig="levities" auto="true">levity's</normalised> of youth and the extravagance of pleasure.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.6

He had a very good understanding: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.7

he knew well the state of affairs both at home and abroad.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.8

He had a softness of temper, that charmed all who came near him, till
they found how little they could depend on good looks, kind words, and
fair promises, in which he was liberal to excess, because he intended
nothing by them but to get rid of importunity, and to silence all further
pressing upon him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.9

He seemed to have no sense of religion: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.10

both at prayers and sacrament he, as it were, took care to satisfy people
that he was in no sort concerned in that about which he was employed:
so that he was very far from being an hypocrite, unless his assisting
at those performances was a sort of hypocrisy, as no doubt it was;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.11

but he was sure not to increase that by any the least appearance of
devotion.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,166.12

He said once to my self, he was no atheist, but he could not think God
would make a man <P_1.1,167> miserable only for taking a little pleasure
out of the way.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.13

He disguised his <normalised orig="popery" auto="true">papery</normalised> to the last: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.14

but when he talked freely, he could not help letting himself out against
the liberty that under the Reformation all men took of inquiring into
matters: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.15

for from their inquiring into matters of religion, they carried the humour
further, to inquire into matters of state.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.16

He said often, he thought government was a much safer and easier
thing where the authority was believed infallible, and the faith and
submission of the people was implicit: about which I had once much
discourse with him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.17

He was affable and easy, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.18

and loved to be made so by all about him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.19

The great art of keeping him long was, the being easy, and the making
every thing easy to him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.20

He had made such observations on the French government, that he thought
a king who might be checked, or have his ministers called to an account
by a parliament, was but a king in name.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.21

He had a great compass of knowledge, though he was never capable of
great application or study.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.22

He understood the mechanics and physic; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.23

and was a good chemist, and much set on several preparations of mercury,
chiefly the fixing it.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.24

He understood navigation well: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.25

but above all he knew the architecture of ships so perfectly, that
in that respect he was exact rather more than became a prince.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.26

His apprehension was quick, and his memory good; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.27

and he was an everlasting talker.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.28

He told his stories with a good grace: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.29

but they came in his way too often.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.30

He had a very ill opinion both of men and women; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,167.31

and did not think there was either sincerity or chastity in <P_1.1,168>
the world out of principle, but that some had either the one or the
other out of humour or vanity.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.32

He thought that nobody served him out of love: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.33

and so he was quits with all the world, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.34

and loved others as little as he thought they loved him.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.35

He hated business, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.36

and could not be easily brought to mind any: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.37

but when it was necessary, and he was set to it, he would stay as long
as his ministers had work for him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.38

The ruin of his reign, and of all his affairs, was occasioned chiefly
by his delivering himself up at his first coming over to a mad range
of pleasure.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.39

One of the race of the <normalised orig="Villiers" auto="true">Valour's</normalised>, then married to Palmer, a <normalised orig="papist" auto="true">peppiest</normalised>,
soon after made earl of Castlemaine, who afterwards, being separated
from him, was advanced to be duchess of Cleveland, was his first and
longest mistress, by whom he had five children.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,168.40

She was a woman of great beauty, but most enormously vicious and ravenous,
foolish but imperious, <P_1.1,169> ever uneasy to the king, and always
carrying on intrigues with other men, while yet she pretended she was
jealous of him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.41

His passion for her, and her strange behaviour towards him, did so
disorder him, that often he was not master of himself, nor capable
of minding business, which, in so critical a time, required great
application: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.42

but he did then so entirely trust the earl of <normalised orig="Clarendon" auto="true">Chlorination</normalised> that he left
all to his care, and submitted to his <normalised orig="advices" auto="true">advises</normalised> as to so many oracles.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.43

The earl of <normalised orig="Clarendon" auto="true">Chlorination</normalised> was bred to the law, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.44

and was like to grow eminent in his profession.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.45

When the wars began he distinguished himself so in the house of commons ,
that he became considerable, and was much trusted all the while the king
was at Oxford.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.46

He stayed beyond sea following the king's fortunes, till the restoration
; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.47

and was now an absolute favourite, and the chief or the only minister,
but with too magisterial a way.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.48

He was always pressing the king to mind his affairs, but in vain.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.49

He was a good chancellor, only a little too rough, but very impartial
in the administration of justice.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.50

He never seemed to understand foreign affairs well:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.51

and yet he meddled too much in them.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.52

He had too much levity in his wit, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.53

and did not always observe the decorum of his post.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.54

He was haughty, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.55

and was apt to reject those who addressed themselves to him, with too
much contempt.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.56

He had such regard to the king, that when places were disposed of, even
otherwise than as he advised, yet he would justify what the king did,
and disparage the pretensions of others, not without much scorn; which
created him many enemies.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,169.57

He was indefatigable in business, <P_1.1,170> though the gout did often
disable him from waiting on the king: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.58

yet, during his credit, the king came constantly to him when he was laid
up by the gout.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.59

The man next to him in favour with the king was the duke of <normalised orig="Ormond" auto="true">Armband</normalised>:
a man every way fitted for a court, of a graceful appearance, a lively
wit, and a cheerful temper: a man of great expense, decent even in his
vices, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.60

for he always kept up the forms of religion.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.61

He had gone through many transactions in Ireland with more fidelity
than success.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.62

He had made a treaty with the Irish, which was broken by the
great body of them, though some few of them adhered still to him.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.63

But the whole Irish nation did still pretend, that, though they broke
the agreement first, yet he, or rather the king in whose name he had
treated with them, was bound to perform all the articles of the treaty.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.64

He had miscarried so in the siege of Dublin that it very much lessened
the opinion of his military conduct: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.65

yet his constant attendance on his master, his easiness to him, and his
great sufferings for him, raised him to be lord steward of the household,
and lord lieutenant of Ireland.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.66

He was firm to the protestant religion, and so far firm to the laws that
he always gave good <normalised orig="advices" auto="true">advises</normalised>: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.67

but even when bad ones were followed, he was not for complaining too
much of them.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.68

The earl of Southampton was next to these.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.69

He was a man of great virtues, and of very good parts:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.70

he had a lively apprehension, and a good judgment.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.71

He had merited much by his constant adhering to the king's interests
during the war, and by the large supplies he had sent him every year
during his exile; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.72

for he had a great estate, and only three daughters to inherit it.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.73

He was made lord treasurer: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.74

but he grew soon weary of business; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.75

for as he was subject to the stone, which returned often and
violently upon him, so he retained the principles of liberty,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.76

and did not go in to the violent measures of the court.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,170.77

When he saw the king's temper, and his way of managing, or
rather of spoiling, <P_1.1,171> business, he grew very uneasy,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.78

and kept himself more out of the way than was consistent with that
high post.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.79

The king stood in some awe of him, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.80

and saw how popular he would grow if put out of his service:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.81

and therefore he chose rather to bear with his ill humour and
contradiction, than to dismiss him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.82

He left the business of the treasury wholly in the hands of his
secretary, sir Philip Warwick, who was an honest but a weak man;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.83

he understood the common road of the treasury; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.84

but, though he pretended to wit and politics, he was not cut out for that,
and least of all for writing of history.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.85

But he was an <normalised orig="incorrupt" auto="true">incorruptible</normalised> man, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.86

and during seven years management of the treasury he made but an ordinary
fortune out of it.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.87

Before the restoration the lord treasurer had only a small salary,
with an allowance for a table, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.88

but he gave, or rather sold, all the <normalised orig="subaltern" auto="true">splattering</normalised> places,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.89

and made great profits out of the estate of the crown:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.90

but now, that being gone, and the earl of Southampton disdaining to
sell places, the matter was settled so, that the lord treasurer was to
have +L8000 a year, and the king was to name all the <normalised orig="subaltern" auto="true">splattering</normalised> officers.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.91

And it continued to be so all his time: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.92

but since that time the lord treasurer has both the +L8000 and a main
hand in the disposing of those places.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,171.93

<P_1.1,172>

The man that was in the greatest credit with the earl of Southampton
was sir Anthony Ashley Cooper, who had married his niece, and became
afterwards so considerable, that he was raised to be earl of Shaftesbury.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.95

Since he came to have so great a name, and that I knew him for many
years, and in a very particular manner, I will dwell a little longer on
his character; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.96

for it was of a very extraordinary composition.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.97

He began to make a considerable figure very early.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.98

Before he was twenty, he came into the house of commons,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.99

and was on the king's side, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.100

and undertook to get Wiltshire and Dorsetshire to declare for him,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.101

but he was not able to effect it.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.102

Yet prince Maurice breaking articles to a town that he had got to receive
him, furnished him with an excuse to forsake that side, and to turn to
the parliament.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.103

He had a wonderful faculty in speaking to a popular assembly,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.104

and could mix both the facetious and the serious way of arguing very
agreeably.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.105

He had a particular talent of making others trust to his judgment,
and depend on it: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.106

and he brought over so many to a submission to his opinion, that I never
knew any man equal to him in the art of governing parties, and of making
himself the head of them.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.107

He was, as to religion, a <normalised orig="deist" auto="true">doest</normalised> at best.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,172.108

He had the dotage of astrology in him to a high <P_1.1,173> degree:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.109

he told me, that a Dutch doctor had from the stars foretold him the
whole series of his life.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.110

But that which was before him, when he told me this, proved false,
if he told true: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.111

for he said he was yet to be a greater man than he had been.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.112

He fancied that after death our souls lived in stars.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.113

He had a general knowledge of the slighter parts of learning,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.114

but understood little to bottom: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.115

so he triumphed in a rambling way of talking, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.116

but argued slightly when he was held close to any point.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.117

He had a wonderful faculty at opposing, and running things down;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.118

but had not the like force in building up.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.119

He had such an extravagant vanity in setting himself out, that it was
very disagreeable.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.120

He pretended that Cromwell offered to make him king.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.121

He was indeed of great use to him, in withstanding the enthusiasts of
that time.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.122

He was one of those who pressed him most to accept of the kingship,
because, as he said afterwards, he was sure it would ruin him.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.123

His strength lay in the knowledge of England, and of all the considerable
men in it.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.124

He understood well the size of their understanding and their tempers:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.125

and he knew how to apply himself to them so dexterously, that, though
by his changing sides so often it was very visible how little he was
to be depended on, yet he was to the last much trusted by all the
discontented party.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.126

He had no sort of virtue, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.127

for he was both a lewd and corrupt man BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.128

and had no regard either to truth or justice.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.129

He was not ashamed to reckon up the many turns he had made:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.130

and he valued himself on the doing it at the properest season, and in
the best manner: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,173.131

and was not out of countenance in owning his <P_1.1,174> unsteadiness
and deceitfulness.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.132

This he did with so much vanity, and so little discretion, that he lost
many by it, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.133

and his reputation was at last run so low that he could not have held
much longer, had not he died in good time, either for his family or for
his party.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.134

The former would have been ruined if he had not saved it by betraying
his party.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.135

Another man very near of the same sort, who passed through many
great employments, was <normalised orig="Annesley" auto="true">Angela</normalised>, advanced to be earl of <normalised orig="Anglesea" auto="true">Angles</normalised>;
who had much more knowledge, and was very learned, chiefly in the law.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.136

He had a faculty of speaking indefatigably upon every subject:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.137

but he spoke <normalised orig="ungracefully" auto="true">incorrigibly</normalised>, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.138

and did not know that he was ill at raillery, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.139

for he was always attempting it.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.140

He understood our government well, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.141

and had examined far into the original of our constitution.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.142

He was capable of great application, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.143

and was a man of a grave deportment, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.144

but stuck at nothing, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.145

and was ashamed of nothing.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.146

He was neither loved nor trusted by any man or any side:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.147

and he seemed to have no regard to the common decencies of justice and
truth, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.148

but sold every thing that was in his power: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.149

and sold himself so often, that at last the price fell so low that he grew
useless, because he was so well known that he was universally despised.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,174.150

<P_1.1,175>

<normalised orig="Holles" auto="true">Holes</normalised> was a man of great courage, and of as great pride.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.152

He was counted for many years the head of the presbyterian party.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.153

He was faithful and firm to his side, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.154

and never changed through the whole course of his life.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.155

He engaged in a particular opposition to Cromwell in the time of the war.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.156

They hated one another equally.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.157

<normalised orig="Holles" auto="true">Holes</normalised> seemed to carry this too far: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.158

for he would not allow Cromwell to have been either wise or brave;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.159

but often applied <normalised orig="Solomon's" auto="true">Salmon's</normalised> observation to him, <font> that the battle
was not to the strong, nor favour to the men of understanding, but that
time and chance happened to all men <$$font>.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.160

He was well versed in the records of parliament,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.161

and argued well, but too vehemently; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.162

for he could not bear contradiction.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.163

He had the soul of an old stubborn Roman in him.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.164

He was a faithful but a rough friend, and a severe but fair enemy.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.165

He had a true sense of religion, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.166

and was a man of an <normalised orig="unblameable" auto="true">inflammable</normalised> course of life, and of a sound judgment
when it was not <normalised orig="biassed" auto="true">biased</normalised> by passion.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.1,175.167

He was made a lord for his merit in bringing about the restoration.

<$$heading>

Three days before <normalised orig="Michaelmas" auto="true">Miscalling</normalised> Dr. <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> came to me.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.175

I had known him at Sir Robert Moray's.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.176

He was a gardener and a chemist, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.177

and was full of projects and notions.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.178

He had got some credit in <normalised orig="Cromwell's" auto="true">Cromwell</normalised> time, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.179

and that kept him poor.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.180

He was a very mean divine, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.181

and seemed credulous and simple, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.182

but I had always looked on him as a sincere man.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.183

At this time he told me of strange designs against the king's person;
and that <normalised orig="Coniers" auto="true">Converse</normalised>, a Benedictine, had provided himself of a poniard,
with which he undertook to kill him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.184

I was amazed at all this, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.185

and did not know whether he was crazed, or had come to me on design to
involve me in a concealing of treason.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.186

So I went to Lloyd, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.187

and sent him to the secretary's office with an account of that discourse
of <normalised orig="Tonge's" auto="true">Conga's</normalised>, since I would not be guilty of misprision of treason.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.188

He found at the office that <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> was making discoveries there, of which
they made no other account but that he intended to get himself to be
made a dean.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.189

I told this next morning to Littleton and <normalised orig="Powle" auto="true">Poole</normalised>,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.190

and they looked on it as a design of <normalised orig="Danby's" auto="true">Damps</normalised>, to be laid before the next
session, thereby to dispose them to keep up a greater force, since the
papists were plotting against the king's life.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.191

This would put an end to all jealousies of the king, now the papists
were conspriring against his life.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.192

But lord Halifax, when I told him of it, had another apprehension of it.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,156.193

He said, considering the suspicions all had of the duke's religion,
he believed every discovery of that sort would raise a flame which the
court <P_1.2,157> would not be able to manage.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.194

Two days after that, <normalised orig="Titus" auto="true">Tit's</normalised> <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> was brought before the council.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.195

He was the son of an <normalised orig="anabaptist" auto="true">unbaptized</normalised> teacher, who afterwards conformed
and got into orders, and took a benefice, as this his son did.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.196

He was proud and ill natured, haughty, but ignorant.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.197

He conversed much with <normalised orig="Socinians" auto="true">Skeining</normalised>, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.198

and had been complained of for some very indecent expressions concerning
the mysteries of the Christian religion.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.199

He was once presented for perjury, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.200

but he got to be a chaplain in one of the king's ships, from which he was
dismissed upon a complaint of some unnatural practices, not to be named.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.201

He got a qualification from the duke of Norfolk as one of his chaplains
: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.202

and there he fell into much discourse with the priests that were about
that family.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.203

He seemed inclined to be instructed in the <normalised orig="popish" auto="true">popes</normalised> religion.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.204

One Hutchinson, a <normalised orig="Jesuit" auto="true">Jest</normalised>, had that work put on him.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.205

He was a weak and light-headed man, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.206

and afterwards came over to the church of England.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.207

He was a curate about the city near a year, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.208

and came oft to me, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.209

and preached once for me.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.210

He seemed to be a sincere, devout man, who did not at all love the order,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.211

for he found they were a crafty, deceitful and meddling sort of people.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.212

They never trusted him with any secrets, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.213

but employed him wholly in making converts.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.214

He went afterwards back to that church.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.215

So all this was thought a juggle only to cast an odium upon <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised>.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.216

He told me that <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> and they were always in ill terms.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,157.217

They did not allow him above <normalised orig="ninepence" auto="true">ninepins</normalised> a day, of which he
complained <P_1.2,158> much, and Hutchinson relieved him often.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.218

They wished they could be well rid of him, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.219

and sent him beyond sea, being in very ill terms with him.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.220

This made him conclude, that they had not at that time trusted him with
their secrets.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.221

He was kept for some time at S. <normalised orig="Omer's" auto="true">Homer's</normalised>, and from thence sent
through France into Spain, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.222

and was now returned into England.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.223

He had been long acquainted with <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised>, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.224

and made his first discovery to him, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.225

and by the means of one Kirby a chemist, that was sometimes in
the king's laboratory, they signified the thing to the king.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.226

So <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> had an audience, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.227

and told the king a long thread of many passages, all tending to the
taking away his life; of which the king, as he afterwards told me,
knew not what it could amount to, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.228

yet among so many particulars he did not know but there might be some
truth.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.229

So he sent him to <normalised orig="Danby" auto="true">Danube</normalised>, who intended to make some use of it, but
could not give much credit to it, and handled the matter too <normalised orig="remissly" auto="true">ruinously</normalised>:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.230

for, if at first the thing had been traced quick, either the truth
or the imposture of the whole affair might have been made appear.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.231

The king ordered <normalised orig="Danby" auto="true">Danube</normalised> to say nothing of it to the duke.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.232

In the mean while some letters of an odd strain relating to plots and
discoveries were sent by the post to Windsor, directed to Bedingfield,
the duke's confessor; who, when he read them, carried them to the duke,
and protested he did not know what they meant, nor from whom they came.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.233

The duke carried them to the king: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.234

and he fancied they were writ either by <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> or <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised>, and sent on
design to have them intercepted for giving credit to the discovery.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.235

The duke's enemies on the other hand gave out that he had got some hints
of the discovery, and brought these as a blind to impose on the king.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,158.236

The matter lay in a secret and remiss management for six <P_1.2,159>
weeks.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.237

At last, on <normalised orig="Michaelmas" auto="true">Miscalling</normalised> eve, <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> was brought before the council,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.238

and entertained them with a long relation of many discourses he
had heard among the <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised>, of their design to kill the king.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.239

He named persons, places, and times, almost without number.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.240

He said many <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised> had disguised themselves, and were gone to Scotland ,
and held field <normalised orig="conventicles" auto="true">convent's</normalised>, on design to distract the government there.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.241

He said he was sent first to St. <normalised orig="Omer's" auto="true">Homer's</normalised>, then to Paris, and from
thence to Spain, to negotiate this design; and that upon his return,
$that he brought many letters and directions from beyond sea, there was a
great meeting of the <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised> held in London, in April last, in different
rooms in a tavern near St. <normalised orig="Clement's" auto="true">Clements</normalised>; and that he was employed
to convey the resolutions of those in one room to those in another,
and so to hand them round.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.242

The issue of the consultation was, that they came to a resolution to
kill the king by shooting, stabbing, or poisoning him.  That several
attempts were made, all which failed in the execution, as shall be told
when the trials are related.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.243

While he was going on, waiting for some certain evidence to
accompany his discovery, he perceived they were jealous of him,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.244

and so he <normalised orig="durst" auto="true">dared</normalised> not trust himself among them any more.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.245

In all this there was not a word of <normalised orig="Coniers" auto="true">Converse</normalised>, of which <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> had spoke
to me: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.246

so that was dropped.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.247

This was the substance of what he told the first day.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.248

Many <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised> were upon this seized on that night, and the next day,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.249

and their papers were sealed up.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.250

Next day he accused Coleman of a strict correspondence with P.
de la Chaise, whose name he had not right, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,159.251

for he called him <P_1.2,160> Father le <normalised orig="Shee" auto="true">She</normalised>: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.252

and he said in general that Coleman was acquainted with all their designs.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.253

Coleman had a whole day to make his escape, if he had thought he was in
any danger.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.254

And he had conveyed all his papers out of the way:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.255

only he forgot a drawer under a table, in which the papers relating to
74, 75, and a part of 76 were left: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.256

and from these I drew the negotiations that I have formerly mentioned
as directed by him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.257

If he had either left all his papers or withdrawn all, it had been happy
for his party.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.258

Nothing had appeared if all had been destroyed: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.259

or if all had been left, it might have been concluded that the whole
secret lay in them.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.260

But he left enough to give great jealousy, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.261

and no more appearing all was believed that the witnesses had deposed.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.262

Coleman was out of the way the second day, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.263

but hearing that there was a warrant out against him, he delivered
himself next day to the secretary of state.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.264

When <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> and he were confronted, <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> did not know him at first:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.265

but he named him when he heard him speak, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.266

yet he only charged him upon hearsay: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.267

so he was put in a messenger's hands.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.268

<normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> named <normalised orig="Wakeman" auto="true">Watchman</normalised>, the queen's physician, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.269

but did not know him at all, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.270

and being asked if he knew anything against him, he answered he did not,
adding, God forbid he should say any thing more than he knew, he would
not do that for all the world.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.271

Nor did he name <normalised orig="Langhorn" auto="true">Longhorn</normalised>, the famous lawyer, that indeed managed all
their concerns.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.272

The king found him out in one thing: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.273

he said, when he was in Spain, he was carried to Don John, who
promised great assistance in the execution of their designs.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.274

The king, who knew Don John well, asked him what sort of a man he was :
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.275

he answered, he was a tall lean man: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.276

now Don John was a little fat man.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.277

At first he seemed to design to recommend himself to the duke and the
ministers: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,160.278

for he said he heard the <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised> oft <P_1.2,161> say, that the duke was
not sure enough to them: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.279

and they were in doubt whether he would approve of their killing the
king: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.280

but they were resolved if they found him stiff in that matter to despatch
him likewise.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.281

He said they had oft made use of his name, and counterfeited his hand
and seal without his knowledge.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.282

He said the <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised> cherished the faction in Scotland against Lauderdale ;
and intended to murder the duke of <normalised orig="Ormond" auto="true">Armband</normalised>, as a great enemy to all their
designs: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.283

and he affirmed he had seen many letters in which these things were
mentioned, and had heard them oft spoke of.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.284

He gave a long account of the burning of London, at which time he said
they intended to have killed the king: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.285

but they relented when they saw him so active in quenching the fire,
that, as he said, they had kindled.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.286

The whole town was all over inflamed with this discovery.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.287

It consisted of so many particulars that it was thought to be above
invention.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.288

But when <normalised orig="Coleman's" auto="true">Columbine's</normalised> letters came to be read and examined, it got a great
confirmation; since by these it appeared that so many years before, they
thought the designs for the converting the nation, and rooting out the
pestilent heresy that had reigned so long in these northern kingdoms,
was very near its being executed: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.289

mention was oft made of the duke's great zeal for it:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.290

and as many indecent reflections were made on the king, for his
<normalised orig="unconstancy" auto="true">inconstancy</normalised>, and his disposition to be brought to anything for money.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.291

They depended upon the French king's assistance:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.292

and therefore were earnest in their endeavours to bring about a general
peace, as that which must finish their design.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.293

On the second day after this discovery, the king went to Newmarket.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,161.294

<P_1.2,162>

This was censured as a very indecent levity in him, to go and see horse
races, when all people were so much possessed with this extraordinary
discovery, to which <normalised orig="Coleman's" auto="true">Columbine's</normalised> letters had gained an universal credit.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.296

While the king was gone, <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> desired to speak with me.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.297

So I went to him to Whitehall, where both he and <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> were lodged under
a guard.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.298

I found him so lifted up, that he seemed to have lost the little sense
he had.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.299

<normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> came in BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.300

and made me a compliment, that I was one that was marked out to be killed.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.301

He had before said the same of Stillingfleet, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.302

but he made that honour he did us too cheap, when he said <normalised orig="Tonge" auto="true">Tongue</normalised> was to
be served in the same manner, because he had translated the <normalised orig="Jesuits'" auto="true">Jesuits</normalised>
morals into English.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.303

He broke out into great fury against the <normalised orig="Jesuits" auto="true">Jests</normalised>,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.304

and said he would have their blood: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.305

but I, to divert him from that strain, asked him, what were the arguments
that prevailed on him to change his religion, and to go over to the
church of Rome?  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.306

He upon that stood up, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.307

and laid his hands on his breast, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.308

and said, God and his holy angels knew that he had never changed
, but that he had gone among them on purpose to betray them.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.309

This gave me such a character of him, that I could have no
regard to anything that he either said or swore after that.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.310

A few days after this a very extraordinary thing happened, that
contributed more than any other thing to the establishing the belief of
all this evidence.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.311

Sir Edmund Berry Godfrey was an eminent justice of peace, that lived
near Whitehall.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.312

He had the courage to stay in London, and keep things in order, during the
plague, which gained him much reputation, and upon which he was knighted.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.313

He was esteemed the best justice of peace in England,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.314

and kept the quarter where he lived in very good order.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.315

He was then entering upon a great design of taking up all beggars,
and putting them to work.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.316

He was thought vain and apt to take too much upon him:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.317

but there are so few men of public spirits, that small faults
, though they lessen them, yet ought to be gently censured.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.318

I knew him well, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,162.319

<P_1.2,163>

and never had reason to think him faulty that way.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.321

He was a zealous protestant, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.322

and loved the church of England, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.323

but had kind thoughts of the nonconformists, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.324

and was not forward to execute the laws against them:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.325

and he, to avoid the being put on doing that, was not apt to search
for priests or mass-houses: so that few men of his zeal lived in better
terms with the papists than {in} he did.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.326

<normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> went to him the day before he appeared at the council board;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.327

and made oath of the narrative he intended to make, which he afterwards
published.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.328

This seemed to be done in distrust of the privy council, as if they
might stifle his evidence; which to prevent, he put it in safe hands.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.329

Upon that Godfrey was <normalised orig="chid" auto="true">chide</normalised> for his meddling in so tender a matter;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.330

and it was generally believed that Coleman and he were long in a private
conversation, between the time of his {COM:Coleman's} being put in the
messenger's hands and his being made a close prisoner: which was done as
soon as report was made to the council of the contents of his letters.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.331

It is certain Godfrey grew apprehensive and reserved:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.332

for meeting me on the streets, after some discourse of the present state
of affairs, he said he believed he himself should be knocked on the head.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.333

Yet he took no care of himself, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.334

and went about, according to his own maxim, still without a servant,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.335

for he used to say that the servants in London were corrupted by the
idleness and ill company they fell into while they attended on their
masters.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.336

On that day fortnight in which <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> had made his discovery, being a
Saturday, he went abroad in the morning, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.337

and was seen about one o'clock near S. <normalised orig="Clement's" auto="true">Clements</normalised> church,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.338

but was never seen any more.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.339

He was a punctual man to good hours: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.340

so his servants were amazed when he did not come home:
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.341

yet, he having an ancient mother that lived at Hammersmith, they
fancied he had heard she was dying, and so was gone to see her.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.342

Next morning they sent thither, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.343

but heard no news of him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.344

So his two brothers, who lived in the city, were sent to.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.345

They were not acquainted with his affairs: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,163.346

so they did not know whether <P_1.2,164> he might not have stepped aside
for debt, since at that time all people were calling in their money,
which broke a great many: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.347

but no creditor coming about the house, they on Tuesday published his
being thus lost.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.348

The council sat upon it, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.349

and were going to order a search of all the houses about the town;
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.350

but were diverted from it, by many stories that were brought them by
the duke of Norfolk: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.351

sometimes it was said he was indecently married,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.352

and the scene was often shifted of the places where it was said he was.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.353

<normalised orig="Norfolk's" auto="true">Norfolk</normalised> officiousness in this matter, and the last place he was
seen at being near <normalised orig="Arundel" auto="true">Armadillo</normalised> house, brought him under great suspicion.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.354

On Thursday one came into a bookseller's shop after dinner,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.355

and said he was found thrust through with a sword.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.356

That was presently brought as news to me, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.357

but the reporter of it was not known.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.358

That night late his body was found in a ditch, about a mile out of town,
near St. <normalised orig="Pancras" auto="true">Pancreas</normalised> church.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.359

His sword was thrust through him, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.360

but no blood was on his clothes or about him.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.361

His shoes were clean, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.362

his money was in his pocket: BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.363

but nothing was about his neck, BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.364

and a mark was all round it, an inch broad, which <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> he was strangled.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.365

His breast was likewise all over marked with bruises,
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.366

and his neck was broken.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.367

All this I saw; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.368

for Lloyd and I went to view his body.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,164.369

There were many drops of white waxlights <P_1.2,165> on his breeches;
which he never used himself; BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.370

and since only persons of quality or priests use those lights,
this made all people conclude in whose hands he must have been.
BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.371

And it was visible he was first strangled, and then carried to that place
, where his sword was run into his dead body.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.372

For a while it was given out that he was a <normalised orig="hypochondriacal" auto="true">hypochondriac's</normalised> man, and had
killed himself.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.373

Of this the king was possessed, till Lloyd went and told him what he
had seen.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.374

The body lay two days exposed, many going to see it, who went away much
moved with the sight.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.375

And indeed men's spirits were so sharpened upon it, that we all looked
on it as a very great happiness that the people did not vent their fury
upon the papists about the town.  BURNETCHA-E3-H,1.2,165.376
