<font> <normalised orig="PROSA" auto="true">PROSE</normalised> <$$font> IX.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.3

<$$heading>

Let it suffice that I have hitherto described the Form of counterfeit
Happiness: So that if thou <normalised orig="considerest" auto="true">consider</normalised> well, my Method will lead me to
give to thee a perfect Draught of the true.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.5

<font> <normalised orig="Boet" auto="true">Poet</normalised>. <$$font> I now see plainly that Men $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} arrive at a full Satisfaction by Riches, nor at Power by
enjoying Principalities or Kingdoms, nor at Esteem and Reverence by the
Accession of Dignities, nor at Nobility by Glory, nor at true Joy by
carnal Pleasures.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.6

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou <normalised orig="sayest" auto="true">say</normalised> well, BOETHPR-E3-H,124.7

but <normalised orig="knowest" auto="true">know</normalised> thou the Causes of all these?  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.8

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I perceive them by the small Light I can
afford to my self, BOETHPR-E3-H,124.9

but I should be very glad to know them more fully from thee.
BOETHPR-E3-H,124.10

<font> Ph. <$$font> The Reason is most obvious, BOETHPR-E3-H,124.11

for humane Error doth separate and divide that which is simple, and by
Nature indivisible, BOETHPR-E3-H,124.12

and doth transport it from that which is true and perfect to their
contrary.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.13

Let me ask thee, can that, <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou think, which <normalised orig="needeth" auto="true">needs</normalised> nothing
want Power?  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.14

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> No, I am not of that Opinion.
BOETHPR-E3-H,124.15

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou <normalised orig="thinkest" auto="true">think</normalised> right indeed; BOETHPR-E3-H,124.16

for if there be any thing which, upon any occasion of Performance, doth
<normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> a Weakness or want of Power, it must, as to that, necessarily need
foreign Aid.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.17

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> So it is.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.18

<font> Ph. <$$font> And therefore Sufficiency and Power are of
one Nature.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.19

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> So it truly seems.  BOETHPR-E3-H,124.20

<P_125>

<font> Ph. <$$font> And <normalised orig="thinkest" auto="true">think</normalised> thou that things of this kind
are to be undervalued and <normalised orig="contemn'd" auto="true">contemned</normalised>, or rather to be reverenced of all?
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.22

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> They are doubtless worthy of Reverence.
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.23

<font> Ph. <$$font> Let us then add to Sufficiency and Power
Reverence, and so then <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> of these three as one.  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.24

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Let us join them then, because the Truth must
be <normalised orig="confess'd" auto="true">confessed</normalised>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.25

<font> Ph. <$$font> What <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou think then?  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.26

Is that an obscure and ignoble thing which is <normalised orig="grac'd" auto="true">graced</normalised> with these
three great Attributes of Self-sufficiency, Power and Reverence,
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.27

or <normalised orig="otherways" auto="true">otherwise</normalised> is it noble and worthy of Fame?  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.28

Consider then, as we have granted before, that he who wants Gifts
of Fortune; who is most powerful, and most worthy of Renown, if he,
I say, want Fame, which he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} give to himself,
he may on that hand, in some measure, seem more weak and abject.
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.29

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} indeed deny it,
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.30

but aver as it is, that Renown attends the aforesaid things.
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.31

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then by consequence Renown differs nothing
from the three <normalised orig="above-mention'd" auto="true">abovementioned</normalised> Attributes.  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.32

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I grant it.  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.33

<font> Ph. <$$font> Must not then that thing which wants not the
Help of another, which can by its own Strength perform every thing which
is famous and reverend, of necessity be joyful also, and always pleasant?
BOETHPR-E3-H,125.34

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} indeed well
comprehend how any Grief or Trouble can possess the Breast of one in
those Circumstances.  BOETHPR-E3-H,125.35

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then we may well grant that such are
always <P_126> in a State of Joy, if what I have said be true.
BOETHPR-E3-H,126.36

And then may we also grant Self-sufficiency, Power, Nobility, Reverence
and Pleasure, do differ only in Name, but not in Essence or Substance.
BOETHPR-E3-H,126.37

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> It is necessarily so.  BOETHPR-E3-H,126.38

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then therefore that which is one simple Nature
is torn violently asunder by the <normalised orig="Pravity" auto="true">Privity</normalised> of Men; BOETHPR-E3-H,126.39

and whilst they endeavour for a part of a thing which wants Parts, they
neither get that Part, nor the entire thing which they so much desire.
BOETHPR-E3-H,126.40

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> How can that be?  BOETHPR-E3-H,126.41

<font> Ph. <$$font> Why thus; BOETHPR-E3-H,126.42

He who in amassing Riches <normalised orig="proposeth" auto="true">proposes</normalised> only to himself the end of avoiding
Poverty, is no way solicitous to obtain Power; BOETHPR-E3-H,126.43

he had rather be unknown and obscure, BOETHPR-E3-H,126.44

and <normalised orig="chuseth" auto="true">chooses</normalised> rather to withdraw from himself many natural Pleasures,
than run the hazard of losing that Money which he hath gathered.
BOETHPR-E3-H,126.45

But surely such an one by this means doth not purchase Self-sufficiency
, when he <normalised orig="loseth" auto="true">loses</normalised> Power, when he is <normalised orig="prick'd" auto="true">pricked</normalised> with Trouble, when his
sordid Ways make him be looked upon as an Out-cast, when he is hidden
in Obscurity.  BOETHPR-E3-H,126.46

If we come to the Person who only aims at Power, he squanders away Riches,
BOETHPR-E3-H,126.47

he <normalised orig="despiseth" auto="true">despises</normalised> Pleasures, BOETHPR-E3-H,126.48

he slights Honour which is not accompanied with Power, BOETHPR-E3-H,126.49

and <normalised orig="contemns" auto="true">condemns</normalised> Glory.  BOETHPR-E3-H,126.50

So then thou <normalised orig="seest" auto="true">see</normalised> how many things that Man <normalised orig="wanteth" auto="true">wants</normalised>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,126.51

For often he must stand in need of Necessaries, BOETHPR-E3-H,126.52

he must be subject to great Anxieties; BOETHPR-E3-H,126.53

and when he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <P_127> drive away these things
, he <normalised orig="shews" auto="true">shows</normalised> clearly his want of that which he did most affect,
BOETHPR-E3-H,127.54

I mean Power.  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.55

One may also reason thus of Honours, of Glory, and of Pleasures.
BOETHPR-E3-H,127.56

For whilst every one of these is the same with the rest, whoever
endeavours to obtain any of these without the other, <normalised orig="loseth" auto="true">loses</normalised> that which
he <normalised orig="desireth" auto="true">desires</normalised>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.57

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> What then if a Man should desire to gain all
these things together?  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.58

<font> Ph. <$$font> I would then say, that he hath a mind to
arrive at the sovereign Good; BOETHPR-E3-H,127.59

but can it be thought that it shall ever be found in these Acquisitions,
which I have <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> already, not to be able to perform any thing they
promise?  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.60

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> No surely.  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.61

<font> Ph. <$$font> In these things therefore which are believed
able to satisfy our Desires, we must by no means seek for Happiness.
BOETHPR-E3-H,127.62

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I confess it, BOETHPR-E3-H,127.63

and nothing can be said more truly than this.  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.64

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> now then the Form and Causes of
that adulterate sophisticate Felicity: BOETHPR-E3-H,127.65

now turn again the Eyes of thy Consideration upon the contrary Prospect,
and thou shalt soon comprehend that true and genuine Happiness which I
so long have promised thee.  BOETHPR-E3-H,127.66

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> That a blind Man may see, BOETHPR-E3-H,127.67

and who runs may read it, BOETHPR-E3-H,127.68

for thou <normalised orig="shewedst" auto="true">showed</normalised> it to me before, when thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> endeavour to open to
me the Causes of its Counterfeit: BOETHPR-E3-H,127.69

for if I be not mistaken, that is the true consummate Felicity which
makes a Man self-sufficient, powerful, reverenced, noble and pleasant.
BOETHPR-E3-H,127.70

And that thou <normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> know that thy Sayings <P_128> have sunk deep into
my Understanding, I say, I know that that which one of these <paren>
for they are all one <$$paren> can truly perform is, without doubt,
the chief Good and true Happiness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,128.71

<font> Ph. <$$font> O my Pupil, thou art most happy in this
Opinion, provided thou wilt add this to it, which I shall offer to thee.
BOETHPR-E3-H,128.72

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> What is that?  BOETHPR-E3-H,128.73

<font> Ph. <$$font> <normalised orig="Thinkest" auto="true">Think</normalised> thou that any thing on this side
Heaven can confer that Good of which thou <normalised orig="speakest" auto="true">speak</normalised>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,128.74

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I think not indeed; BOETHPR-E3-H,128.75

and thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> already <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> me, that nothing can be desired beyond such
a State of Perfection.  BOETHPR-E3-H,128.76

<font> Ph. <$$font> These things then above-mentioned either
confer the Likeness of the true Good, BOETHPR-E3-H,128.77

or else they seem to give me some imperfect Good; BOETHPR-E3-H,128.78

but the true and perfect one this can by no means afford.
BOETHPR-E3-H,128.79

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I agree with you.  BOETHPR-E3-H,128.80

<font> Ph. <$$font> Seeing then thou <normalised orig="knowest" auto="true">know</normalised> already which is
the true Happiness, and which the false one, it remains thou <normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised> be
informed from what Fountain to derive that true one.  BOETHPR-E3-H,128.81

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> That I indeed expect with much Impatience.
BOETHPR-E3-H,128.82

<font> Ph. <$$font> But as <font> Plato <$$font> says in his
<font> <normalised orig="Timaeus" auto="true">Time's</normalised> <$$font>, that <P_129> even in the least things the
Divine Assistance ought to be implored, what <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou think is fit to
be done, that we may deserve to find the true Source and Seat of the
sovereign Good?  BOETHPR-E3-H,129.83

<P_133>

<heading>

<font> <normalised orig="PROSA" auto="true">PROSE</normalised> <$$font> X.  BOETHPR-E3-H,133.86

<$$heading>

Now that thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> had the Character of the true, and also of the false
Felicity truly represented to thee, I think it time to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> thee in what
the Perfection of Happiness is placed.  BOETHPR-E3-H,133.88

And whilst we are in quest of this, I think our best Method will be to
examine, whether there can in Nature be {HELSINKI:bu} such a Good as
that which thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> before <normalised orig="defin'd" auto="true">defined</normalised>, lest the Vanity of Imagination,
and Heat of Thought, should deceive us, and carry us beyond the Truth
of the Matter subjected to our Inquiry.  BOETHPR-E3-H,133.89

But that such a thing doth exist, and that it is as <P_134> it
were the Fountain of all Good, $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be denied;
BOETHPR-E3-H,134.90

for every thing which is said to be imperfect is proved to be so by the
Diminution of that which is perfect.  BOETHPR-E3-H,134.91

Hence it is that if any thing in any kind be said to be imperfect,
it is presently understood that in it there is also something perfect.
BOETHPR-E3-H,134.92

For if Perfection be taken away, no Man can tell in what that which is
said to be imperfect can exist.  BOETHPR-E3-H,134.93

For Nature doth not derive her <normalised orig="Origine" auto="true">Origin</normalised> from things diminished and
<normalised orig="inconsummate" auto="true">unconscionable</normalised>, BOETHPR-E3-H,134.94

but proceeding from an <normalised orig="intire" auto="true">entire</normalised> and absolute Substance, she extends her self
in the remotest and most fruitless Beings.  So that if, as before I have
demonstrated, there be a certain imperfect Felicity, a fading Good, there
must also be, without doubt, a solid and perfect one.  BOETHPR-E3-H,134.95

It is most logically and truly concluded <paren> said I <$$paren>.
BOETHPR-E3-H,134.96

But where this doth reside <paren> continued she <$$paren> thus consider
; BOETHPR-E3-H,134.97

That God the <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised> of all things is good, is proved by the universal
Opinion of all Men.  BOETHPR-E3-H,134.98

For since nothing can be found out which is better than God, who will
deny Him to be good, than whom nothing can be better?  BOETHPR-E3-H,134.99

Reason then doth so clearly demonstrate that God is good; that at the same
time it <normalised orig="evinceth" auto="true">evinced</normalised> the sovereign Good to be in him.  BOETHPR-E3-H,134.100

For if it were not so, he could not be the Ruler of all things;
BOETHPR-E3-H,134.101

for there would be some Being excelling him, which would possess the
perfect Good, and in this World seem <P_135> to excel him, and be
<normalised orig="antienter" auto="true">ancienter</normalised> than he.  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.102

We have already <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> that all perfect things excel those which are
less perfect.  Wherefore that we may not infinitely produce our Reasons,
it must be <normalised orig="confess'd" auto="true">confessed</normalised> that the great God is full of the greatest and most
perfect Goodness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.103

But we have already <normalised orig="shewn" auto="true">shown</normalised> that perfect Goodness is true Happiness.
BOETHPR-E3-H,135.104

Therefore it necessarily follows that true and consummate Happiness
resides only in the great and most perfect God.  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.105

This <paren> returned I <$$paren> I apprehend aright, BOETHPR-E3-H,135.106

nor can I by any means say against it.  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.107

Then I pray thee <paren> saith she <$$paren> see how well and <normalised orig="irrefragably" auto="true">irreproachable</normalised>
thou <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> prove what I have said, to wit, that god is wholly replenished
with the sovereign Good.  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.108

How shall I do that?  <paren> replied I <$$paren>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.109

<normalised orig="Dost" auto="true">Dosed</normalised> thou presume <paren> said he <$$paren> that the Father of all things
hath received this sovereign Good, with which he is proved to abound,
from any thing without himself, or that he hath it so naturally, that
thou <normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised> imagine that He possessing it, and Happiness possessed,
are of different Substances?  BOETHPR-E3-H,135.110

If thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> think that he received it from any foreign Hand, thou
must imagine the Giver to be more excellent than the Receiver.
BOETHPR-E3-H,135.111

But that God is the most excellent of all Beings, most worthily we
confess, if we own then that the sovereign Good is in him by Nature;
BOETHPR-E3-H,135.112

and yet we may conceive that it is not the same that he is, since we
speak of God, who is the Prince <P_136> of Nature, BOETHPR-E3-H,136.113

let him who can find out who it was that joined these so differing things.
BOETHPR-E3-H,136.114

Lastly, whatever doth essentially differ from any thing, it $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be said to be that from which it is understood to differ.
BOETHPR-E3-H,136.115

Therefore that which is in its Nature differing from the chief Good,
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be said to be the Good it self: which to think
of God would be most impious and profane, since nothing can excel him
in Goodness and Worth.  BOETHPR-E3-H,136.116

Nothing that ever was can in its Nature be better than that from which
it <normalised orig="draweth" auto="true">draws</normalised> its Beginnings.  Wherefore that which is the Principle of all
things must, as to its Substance, with the truest reason be concluded
to be the chief of Goods.  BOETHPR-E3-H,136.117

<font> <normalised orig="Boet" auto="true">Poet</normalised>. <$$font> Most right BOETHPR-E3-H,136.118

<font> Phil. <$$font> But Happiness was before granted to be the
chief of Goods.  BOETHPR-E3-H,136.119

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> So it was.  BOETHPR-E3-H,136.120

<font> Ph. <$$font> Therefore it must necessarily be <normalised orig="confess'd" auto="true">confessed</normalised>
that God is the very Happiness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,136.121

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} oppose the Reasons
you have given, BOETHPR-E3-H,136.122

and I confess you have drawn a very right Conclusion from your Premises.
BOETHPR-E3-H,136.123

<font> Ph. <$$font> Look then a little further,
BOETHPR-E3-H,136.124

and see if this Truth can be proved more firmly thus, to wit, that there
$can $not {TEXT:cannot} be two sovereign Goods which differ in themselves:
BOETHPR-E3-H,136.125

For it is clear, that of the Goods which differ, one $can $not
{TEXT:cannot} be what the other is; wherefore neither can be perfect
when one wants the other.  BOETHPR-E3-H,136.126

But it is evident, that that which is not perfect $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be sovereign; BOETHPR-E3-H,136.127

therefore those which are the <P_137> chief Goods can by no means be
diverse in their Natures.  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.128

But I have rightly concluded that Good and Happiness are the chief Good:
wherefore the highest Divinity must certainly be the highest Happiness.
BOETHPR-E3-H,137.129

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Nothing can be truer than this; nothing by
the Course of Reasoning more firm; BOETHPR-E3-H,137.130

nor can any Conclusion be made more becoming of the Divine Majesty.
BOETHPR-E3-H,137.131

<font> Ph. <$$font> Upon the whole Matter then, as Geometricians
, after they have demostrated their Propositions, are wont to infer and
draw their {COM:greek_omitted} or Consequences, in the same manner shall
I deduce to thee something like a Corollary, thus: BOETHPR-E3-H,137.132

Because by the attaining of Beatitude Men are happy, and Beatitude is
Divinity it self, by the attaining of Divinity it is manifest that Men
are made happy.  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.133

But as from <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> being endowed with the <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> of Justice, they are
denominated Just; and from that of Prudence they are pronounced Wise ,
so should they who are possessed of Divinity by parity of reason be
esteemed Gods.  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.134

Every happy Man then is a God; BOETHPR-E3-H,137.135

but by Nature there is only One, BOETHPR-E3-H,137.136

yet by suffering others to participate of the Divine Essence nothing
hinders but there may be Many.  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.137

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> This truly is a very fair and most <normalised orig="pretious" auto="true">precious</normalised>,
call it Deduction or Corollary, which you please.  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.138

<font> Ph. <$$font> But there can be nothing nobler than that
which Reason commands us to subjoin to this.  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.139

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> What is that?  BOETHPR-E3-H,137.140

<font> Ph. <$$font> It is this, BOETHPR-E3-H,137.141

<P_138>

Since Happiness seems to comprehend in it many things, to consider
whether they all, by the Variety of Parts conjoined, do constitute the
Body of Happiness; or whether there may be any one amongst them which may
<normalised orig="compleat" auto="true">complete</normalised> the Substance of it, and to which all the rest may be <normalised orig="referr'd" auto="true">referred</normalised>.
BOETHPR-E3-H,138.143

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I could wish that thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> open these
things to me by recounting them.  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.144

<font> Ph. <$$font> Do not we account Happiness a Good?
BOETHPR-E3-H,138.145

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Yes certainly, BOETHPR-E3-H,138.146

and the chiefest.  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.147

<font> Ph. <$$font> Add then that Good to all the aforesaid things
, BOETHPR-E3-H,138.148

for that Happiness which is Self-sufficiency is also the Height of Power,
of Reverence, of Nobility, of Pleasure.  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.149

What <normalised orig="sayst" auto="true">say</normalised> thou then, BOETHPR-E3-H,138.150

are all these things, as Self-sufficiency, Power, and the rest, Members
and constituting Parts of Happiness; BOETHPR-E3-H,138.151

or are they, as all other things are, to be <normalised orig="referr'd" auto="true">referred</normalised> to the Sovereign
Good as their Source and Principle?  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.152

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I well understand what thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> aim to search
for, BOETHPR-E3-H,138.153

but I desire to hear what thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> propose.  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.154

<font> Ph. <$$font> Observe then the thing thus sifted and
distinguished upon.  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.155

If all these things were Members of Happiness, they would differ amongst
themselves; BOETHPR-E3-H,138.156

for it is of the Nature of differing Parts to compose one Body:
BOETHPR-E3-H,138.157

But it is already demonstrated that all things are the same,
BOETHPR-E3-H,138.158

therefore they are not Parts; BOETHPR-E3-H,138.159

for if so, even out of one of them Happiness might be composed, which
is absurd.  BOETHPR-E3-H,138.160

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> This I doubt not; BOETHPR-E3-H,138.161

but I desire to <P_139> hear that which remains.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.162

<font> Ph. <$$font> It is clear that all other things are brought
to be tried by Good as the Rule and Square: BOETHPR-E3-H,139.163

For Self-sufficiency is therefore desired, because it is thought to be
Good: BOETHPR-E3-H,139.164

So also it may be said of Power, Esteem, Nobility, Pleasure.
BOETHPR-E3-H,139.165

Good then, is the Cause why all things are desired; BOETHPR-E3-H,139.166

for that which neither in Reality nor <normalised orig="Shew" auto="true">Show</normalised> doth retain any thing of Good,
is by no means to be desired: BOETHPR-E3-H,139.167

On the contrary, whatever by Nature is not good, if yet it seems to be
so, is desired as if it really were so.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.168

Hence it is that Goodness, justly looked upon, is the Cause, the Sum ,
the Hinge from which all our Desires arise, in which they centre, and
upon which they turn.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.169

That which is the Cause of our desiring any thing, seems it self most
to be desired.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.170

For if any Man desires to ride abroad because of his Health, he doth
not so much desire the Motion of Riding as the Effect of his Health.
BOETHPR-E3-H,139.171

Since therefore all things are sought after for the sake of Good,
they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be more desirable than Good it self.
BOETHPR-E3-H,139.172

But we have before <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> that it is Happiness for which all these
abovesaid things are desired, where it is clear that only Happiness is
sought for.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.173

He then who considers this $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deny that Good and
Happiness are of one and the same Substance.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.174

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I see no Cause why any Man should dissent
from your Opinion.  BOETHPR-E3-H,139.175

<font> Ph. <$$font> And we have <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> that God and Happiness
are <P_140> inseparably joined in Essence.  BOETHPR-E3-H,140.176

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> You have so done.  BOETHPR-E3-H,140.177

<font> Ph. <$$font> We may then securely conclude that the Nature
and Substance of God resides in Good, and can be sought for no where else.

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> At an infinite rate; if at the same

BOETHPR-E3-H,141.186

<font> Ph. <$$font> That thou shalt do so, I shall make clear to
thee by undeniable Reasons, if thou wilt but grant me those things which
a little before I have laid down as Conclusions.  BOETHPR-E3-H,141.187

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I grant <P_142> them all.  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.188

<font> Ph. <$$font> Have not I made it clear that those things
which are desired by most are not therefore true and perfect Goods,
because they differ amongst themselves; and that when one is absent,
the other $can $not {TEXT:cannot} confer absolute Happiness?  And then
that they are the perfect Good when they are molded up into one Form,
that is to say, when Self-sufficiency, Power, Veneration, Renown and
Pleasure collectively meet.  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.189

For if they be not one and the same thing, they have nothing to
recommend them, or to make them to be <normalised orig="numbred" auto="true">numbered</normalised> amongst desirable things?
BOETHPR-E3-H,142.190

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I grant thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> demonstrated these things,
BOETHPR-E3-H,142.191

nor can they by any means be doubted of.  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.192

<font> Ph. <$$font> These things then when they are distinct not
being Goods, and when they meet immediately being made Goods, do not
they owe their Beings of Good to Unity?  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.193

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> So it seems to me.  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.194

<font> Ph. <$$font> But wilt thou yield that every thing which
is good, is so by the Participation of the sovereign Good, or not?
BOETHPR-E3-H,142.195

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> It is certainly so.  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.196

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou must then by the same Reason <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised>
Unity and Good to be the same thing: BOETHPR-E3-H,142.197

for the Substance of those things must be the same, whose Effects do
not naturally differ.  BOETHPR-E3-H,142.198

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deny it.
BOETHPR-E3-H,142.199

<font> Ph. <$$font> <normalised orig="Knowest" auto="true">Know</normalised> thou then that every Being doth so long
endure and subsist as it is entire and knit together by Unity; but that
as soon as it looses that Bond it is <normalised orig="dissolv'd" auto="true">dissolved</normalised>, and Privation follows?
BOETHPR-E3-H,142.200

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> How <P_143> <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou make out that?
BOETHPR-E3-H,143.201

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thus; BOETHPR-E3-H,143.202

As in Animals or sensitive Creatures it is plain, the Soul and Body
being united and continuing together, the Being then is called Animal,
a living Creature: BOETHPR-E3-H,143.203

But so soon as this Unity is dissolved by the Separation of these
, it immediately <normalised orig="perisheth" auto="true">perishes</normalised>, ceasing to be what it was before.
BOETHPR-E3-H,143.204

The Body also it self, which whilst it remains in one Form by the
Conjunction of its Members, retains the Form and Resemblance of a Man; but
if by <normalised orig="dissevering" auto="true">discovering</normalised> and segregating the Parts that Oneness is distracted,
it is no more what before it was.  In the same manner, if we run through
all other Beings, it will surely appear, that every thing, as long as
it <normalised orig="preserveth" auto="true">preserves</normalised> Unity doth subsist; BOETHPR-E3-H,143.205

and if that dies, the other must also die with it.  BOETHPR-E3-H,143.206

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Though I consider never so long, yet I can
see no other thing.  BOETHPR-E3-H,143.207

<font> Ph. <$$font> Is there then any thing, which inasmuch as
it lives naturally, doth forgo its Desire of Subsisting, and affect
Corruption and Annihilation?  BOETHPR-E3-H,143.208

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> If I consider those living Creatures which
have any Power of willing or refusing, I do not in Nature find any thing
, which without some foreign Impulse, or the Concurrence of outward
Accidents, doth cast away its Intention and Desire of subsisting, and
willingly hasten to Destruction; BOETHPR-E3-H,143.209

for every Animal is endowed with that great Principle of Self-preservation
, BOETHPR-E3-H,143.210

and pursues it, BOETHPR-E3-H,143.211

and doth eschew Mischief and <P_144> Death.  BOETHPR-E3-H,144.212

But if I, casting an Eye upon the Vegetative World, consider Herbs
and Trees, and other inanimate things, I confess I am under a doubt,
and know not well what to think of them.  BOETHPR-E3-H,144.213

<font> Ph. <$$font> But even of these there is no Cause that thou
<normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised> doubt; BOETHPR-E3-H,144.214

for behold Herbs and Trees first choose a convenient Place to grow in,
where their Nature, as much as it can, hinders them from withering and
perishing soon; BOETHPR-E3-H,144.215

for some spring in the Fields, others upon Mountains, BOETHPR-E3-H,144.216

others rise in Lakes and Marshes, BOETHPR-E3-H,144.217

others put forth amongst the Stones; BOETHPR-E3-H,144.218

some choose the most barren Sands for the Place of their Birth;
BOETHPR-E3-H,144.219

and all these, if any Hand should endeavour to transplant them to any
other place, would forthwith wither.  BOETHPR-E3-H,144.220

But Nature gives to every thing that which is agreeable to, and convenient
for them, BOETHPR-E3-H,144.221

and endeavours that they should not perish before their time.
BOETHPR-E3-H,144.222

<normalised orig="Dost" auto="true">Dosed</normalised> thou not know that all Herbs and Trees, as if their Mouths were
<normalised orig="fastned" auto="true">fastened</normalised> downward in the Earth, do draw up their Nourishment by the Root,
and diffuse their Strength and Bark as through their Marrow?  And also
that the softest and most tender Matter, as the Pith or Marrow is, is
always laid up in the most inward Cabinet, and covered by a strong Coat
of Wood; BOETHPR-E3-H,144.223

and the uppermost Garment of Bark is opposed to the Storms and Weather,
as being fitted best to endure them?  BOETHPR-E3-H,144.224

and <normalised orig="canst" auto="true">can</normalised> thou not here behold <P_145> and admire the Diligence and Care
of Nature, which propagates all things by a Multiplicity of Seeds, which
all Men know are as a Foundation for a Building not to remain for a time,
but as if it were for ever?  BOETHPR-E3-H,145.225

And even those things which are thought to be inanimate, do not they
by the same Reason desire that which properly belongs to them, and to
preserve their Beings?  BOETHPR-E3-H,145.226

For why should Levity carry the Flames upward, and Gravity make the
Earth tend downwards towards its Centre, but that these Places and
Motions agree with their several Bodies?  BOETHPR-E3-H,145.227

Furthermore, whatsoever is agreeable to the Nature of any thing, that
preserves that thing, as that which hath an <normalised orig="Abhorrency" auto="true">Abhorrence</normalised> from it corrupts
and destroys it.  BOETHPR-E3-H,145.228

Now that which is hard, as a Stone, doth most tenaciously adhere together
in all its Parts, BOETHPR-E3-H,145.229

and resists an easy Dissolution; BOETHPR-E3-H,145.230

but what things are liquid or flowing, as Air and Water, yield easily
to those who would separate them, BOETHPR-E3-H,145.231

but soon again return and slide back to those things from which they
were divided: BOETHPR-E3-H,145.232

but Fire doth utterly refuse any such Division.  BOETHPR-E3-H,145.233

And now I do not treat of the voluntary Motions of a knowing
and discerning Soul, but of natural Intention and Instinct.
BOETHPR-E3-H,145.234

Thus we swallow our Meat without thinking of it, BOETHPR-E3-H,145.235

and draw our Breath in our Sleep without perceiving it:
BOETHPR-E3-H,145.236

For the Love of Life is not derived to living Creatures from the
Inclinations and Bent of their <P_146> Souls, but only from the Principles
of Nature; BOETHPR-E3-H,146.237

for the Will, often pushed on by urgent Causes, affects and <normalised orig="imbraces" auto="true">embraces</normalised>
that Death which Nature fears and abhors: BOETHPR-E3-H,146.238

And on the contrary, we see that the Works of Generation, by which alone
the Race of Men is propagated, and which Nature always affects, $are
{TEXT:'are'_missing} often restrained by the Will.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.239

Therefore this Love which every thing <normalised orig="beareth" auto="true">bears</normalised> to it self, doth not
proceed from the Motions of the Soul, but from the Intentions of Nature
: BOETHPR-E3-H,146.240

For Providence hath given to all things created by it, this greatest
Cause and Principle of Duration, to wit, a Desire of existing as long
as it can.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.241

Therefore doubt not but every Being hath a natural Appetite towards
Living, and an Abhorrence of Dissolution.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.242

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I now confess that plainly, and without
doubting, I see those things which before seemed uncertain to me.
BOETHPR-E3-H,146.243

<font> Ph. <$$font> I go on then; BOETHPR-E3-H,146.244

Whatever doth desire to subsist and endure, doth also desire Unity;
BOETHPR-E3-H,146.245

for if this be taken away its Essence is dissolved.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.246

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> That is most true.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.247

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then all things desire one thing.
BOETHPR-E3-H,146.248

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I assent.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.249

<font> Ph. <$$font> But I have before demonstrated that that one
thing must be that which is good.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.250

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> You have so, BOETHPR-E3-H,146.251

<font> Ph. <$$font> All things therefore desire Good; which Good
you may describe to be that which is desired of all.  BOETHPR-E3-H,146.252

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Nothing is truer: BOETHPR-E3-H,146.253

For either all things must be reduced to nothing, BOETHPR-E3-H,146.254

and so being destitute of an Head <P_147> float and rove about without
Governance and Order; BOETHPR-E3-H,147.255

or if there be any thing to which all things do tend, that must be the
chief of all Goods.  BOETHPR-E3-H,147.256

<font> Ph. <$$font> I rejoice but too much, O my Pupil;
BOETHPR-E3-H,147.257

for thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> fixed in thy Mind the very middle and manifest Note of
Truth: BOETHPR-E3-H,147.258

but this thing hath been discovered to thee, because a little before
thou <normalised orig="saidst" auto="true">said</normalised> thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> ignorant of it.  BOETHPR-E3-H,147.259

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> What is that?  BOETHPR-E3-H,147.260

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> not know what was the End of all
things: BOETHPR-E3-H,147.261

And this is it which every one desires.  BOETHPR-E3-H,147.262

And because we have from our former Arguments gathered, that Good is that
which is the Subject of all <normalised orig="Mens" auto="true">Men's</normalised> Desires, we must necessarily confess
that Good is the End of all things.  BOETHPR-E3-H,147.263

<$$heading>

<font> <normalised orig="Boet" auto="true">Poet</normalised>. <$$font> I Confess that <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised> Men are not unjustly
called Beasts, BOETHPR-E3-H,177.268

for although they retain the Form and Shapes of an humane Body,
yet the Qualities of their Souls <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> them to be changed into them.
BOETHPR-E3-H,177.269

But I would not have it in the Power of those <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised> Persons, who even
rage with a Desire of destroying just Men, to do so.  BOETHPR-E3-H,177.270

<font> Ph. <$$font> Nor is it in their Power, as shall be <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised>
in a convenient Place; BOETHPR-E3-H,177.271

but if this Power which People think ill Men to have, were taken away
from them, they would be eased of the greatest part of their Punishment
: BOETHPR-E3-H,177.272

For it would almost seem incredible to any one, and it is yet true,
that evil Men must necessarily be more unhappy when they have compassed
what they desire, than when they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} do so:
BOETHPR-E3-H,177.273

For if it be a miserable thing but to have a Will to do an ill thing, it
must be much worse to have a Power to do it; without which the wretched
Desire <P_178> would languish without effect.  BOETHPR-E3-H,178.274

Since then each of these things hath its unhappiness, it must of necessity
be, that a threefold Misfortune must urge those Men who both will, can,
and do commit Wickedness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,178.275

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I grant it, BOETHPR-E3-H,178.276

but I should much desire that evil Men were soon <normalised orig="depriv'd" auto="true">deprived</normalised> of this
Misfortune, I mean of the Power of doing ill.  BOETHPR-E3-H,178.277

<font> Ph. <$$font> They shall be <normalised orig="dispoil'd" auto="true">dispoiled</normalised> of it sooner
than perhaps thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> have them, or than they think they shall:
BOETHPR-E3-H,178.278

For there is nothing of so late a Beginning within the narrow
Bounds of this Life, that can continue long, or expect Immutability;
BOETHPR-E3-H,178.279

and the great Hopes and subtle Machinations of ill Men are by a sudden
and unforeseen End <normalised orig="ruinated" auto="true">reunited</normalised> and destroyed; which thing puts an End to
their Wickedness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,178.280

For if Vice subjects Men to Misery, the longer they are <normalised orig="vitious" auto="true">vicious</normalised>, the
longer they must be miserable; whom I should <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> the most unhappy
of all Beings, if their Unhappiness were not ended at least by Death:
BOETHPR-E3-H,178.281

For if I have made a true Conclusion concerning the Misfortune which
attends Impiety, that Misery must be without end which certainly is
Eternal.  BOETHPR-E3-H,178.282

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> This is a most wonderful Consequence, and
difficult to be granted; BOETHPR-E3-H,178.283

yet I must <normalised orig="acknowledg" auto="true">acknowledge</normalised> it doth but too much agree with those things which
we have concluded before.  BOETHPR-E3-H,178.284

<font> Ph. <$$font> Thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> rightly <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised>: BOETHPR-E3-H,178.285

but he who thinks it hard to assent to a Conclusion, it <P_179> is fit
he should demonstrate that the Premises are untrue, or that from the
Collation of the Propositions a necessary Conclusion is not to be drawn
; BOETHPR-E3-H,179.286

otherwise if the Premises be granted, he hath no Reason to blame the
Inference from them: BOETHPR-E3-H,179.287

for this which I am now about to say will not seem less wonderful,
BOETHPR-E3-H,179.288

but it necessarily follows from what hath been before proposed.
BOETHPR-E3-H,179.289

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> What is that?  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.290

<font> Ph. <$$font> That wicked Men are more happy when they are
punished according to their Demerits, than if they should escape the
Hand of Justice.  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.291

Nor do I now offer to thee that which every Man can think, that the
Manners of ill Men are corrected by Vengeance, and that by fear of Torment
they are reduced to the right way, and that they are Examples to other
Men to fly from things which are blame worthy: BOETHPR-E3-H,179.292

but I, after another manner, believe these Wretches if they escape
Punishment to be unhappy, although no Regard be had to the Correction
and Example.  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.293

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> And what other manner is there besides those
above-mentioned?  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.294

<font> Ph. <$$font> Have we not granted already that the Good
are happy, and the Impious miserable?  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.295

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> We have.  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.296

<font> Ph. <$$font> If then there be any Addition of Good to any
Man's Misery, is not he happier than another, whose Misery is pure and
simple, without the mixture of any manner of Good?  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.297

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> It <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> so to be.  BOETHPR-E3-H,179.298

<font> Ph. <$$font> And if to the same miserable Person, who
<P_180> wants all manner of Goods to those Evils which have already made
him miserable, another should be annexed, is not he to be esteemed much
more unhappy than he whose Misfortune is relieved by the participation
of Good?  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.299

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> What will follow then?  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.300

<font> Ph. <$$font> Evil Men then, even when they are punished ,
have something of Good annexed, to wit, the Punishment it self, which,
as it is the Effect of Justice, is good: BOETHPR-E3-H,180.301

And there is also annexed to the same Persons, when they go unpunished,
something more of Ill, that is to say, Impunity it self, which before
thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> deservedly granted to be an Evil.  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.302

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} deny it.
BOETHPR-E3-H,180.303

<font> Ph. <$$font> Much more unhappy then are impious Wretches
when they meet with an unjust Impunity, than when they fall under a
merited Vengeance.  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.304

But it is manifest, that nothing can be more just than {it_is_just}
that evil Men should be punished, and unjust than {it_is_unjust} that
they should escape Punishment.  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.305

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Who denies it?  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.306

<font> Ph. <$$font> Nor will any Man deny but that every thing
which is just, is good; and on the other hand, whatsoever is unjust,
is ill.  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.307

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> These are consequential to our former
Conclusions: BOETHPR-E3-H,180.308

But I pray thee tell me, <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou believe that there are any Punishments
allotted to Souls after the Death of the Bodies?  BOETHPR-E3-H,180.309

<font> Ph. <$$font> Great ones most certainly; some of which
I believe to be exercised and applied by Sharpness of Pain, <P_181>
others by a kind of Purgative Clemency: BOETHPR-E3-H,181.310

But we will not at this time discourse of these.  BOETHPR-E3-H,181.311

But our Business hitherto hath been, to let thee see that the Power
which thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> imagine to be most <normalised orig="unworthily" auto="true">unearthly</normalised> bestowed upon evil Men,
is indeed none at all: And also that thou <normalised orig="mightst" auto="true">might</normalised> be satisfied that
evil Men, who as thou <normalised orig="didst" auto="true">did</normalised> complain went unpunished, do never indeed
escape Punishment: And also that thou <normalised orig="mightst" auto="true">might</normalised> learn that that Licence of
doing Evil, which thou <normalised orig="prayedst" auto="true">protest</normalised> might soon end, is not long; and that
The <normalised orig="Enjoyers" auto="true">Encores</normalised> would be more unhappy if it were <P_182> longer, and most
wretched of all if it were perpetual.  BOETHPR-E3-H,182.312

After this I <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> that ill Men are more unhappy if they be <normalised orig="dismiss'd" auto="true">dismissed</normalised>
with an unjust Impunity, than if <normalised orig="punish'd" auto="true">punished</normalised> with a just Revenge.
From which Opinion it follows, that then they are <normalised orig="urg'd" auto="true">urged</normalised> and afflicted
with the greatest Punishments when they are believed to escape free.
BOETHPR-E3-H,182.313

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> When I consider intently thy Reasons, I think
nothing can be said more truly.  BOETHPR-E3-H,182.314

but if we look upon the Judgments of Men, who is there to whom these
things seem not only not to be believed, but also not to be heard?
BOETHPR-E3-H,182.315

<font> Ph. <$$font> So it is indeed: BOETHPR-E3-H,182.316

for they who have long been accustomed to Darkness $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
lift up their Eyes to the Light of perspicuous Truth without difficulty
; BOETHPR-E3-H,182.317

and they resemble those Birds which see well by Night, but are blind in
the Day-time: BOETHPR-E3-H,182.318

For whilst they do not regard the Order of things, but only their own
disordered Affections, they vainly imagine the Power of doing Evil,
or Impunity after it is acted, to be an Happiness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,182.319

But now, behold what the Law Eternal <normalised orig="delivereth" auto="true">delivers</normalised>!  BOETHPR-E3-H,182.320

Conform thy Mind to the best things, and then thou shalt have no need
of a <normalised orig="Judg" auto="true">Judge</normalised> to confer upon thee a Reward, since thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> adjoined thy
self to the most excellent things.  BOETHPR-E3-H,182.321

But if thou art inclined to Impiety, and <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> <normalised orig="imbrace" auto="true">embrace</normalised> wicked Practices,
seek for no Avenger without, BOETHPR-E3-H,182.322

for thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> forfeited thy Advantages, and associated <P_183> thy self
with the worst of things: as if thou <normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised> by turns sometimes behold
the Heavens, sometimes the sordid Earth; and that all other things ceasing
from without, thy Eye should seem to carry thee now above the Stars, and
that again thou <normalised orig="shouldst" auto="true">should</normalised> be placed upon the Earth.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.323

But the Multitude doth not consider this.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.324

What then?  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.325

Shall we put our selves into the Company of those which I have before
<normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised> to resemble Beasts?  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.326

What wilt thou say, if a Man who hath quite lost his Sight, and hath
also forgotten that ever he saw, and should think that he wants nothing
to render him perfect, BOETHPR-E3-H,183.327

should we therefore <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> those who retain their Sight to be blind also?
BOETHPR-E3-H,183.328

Either will the <font> Many <$$font> acquiesce in what I shall say,
although it is supported by as firm Reasons, to wit, that those are more
unhappy who do, than they who suffer Injuries.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.329

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I would willingly hear those Reasons.
BOETHPR-E3-H,183.330

<font> Ph. <$$font> <normalised orig="Canst" auto="true">Can</normalised> thou deny but that all ill Men deserve
Punishment?  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.331

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> No, I $can $not {TEXT:cannot}.
BOETHPR-E3-H,183.332

<font> Ph. <$$font> But I am <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> satisfied that impious
Men are many ways unhappy.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.333

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Certainly they are so.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.334

<font> Ph. <$$font> Then thou <normalised orig="doubtest" auto="true">doubt</normalised> not that those who deserve
Punishment are miserable.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.335

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I agree.  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.336

<font> Ph. <$$font> If therefore thou <normalised orig="wert" auto="true">were</normalised> to be <normalised orig="Judg" auto="true">Judge</normalised>, to which
<normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou think thou <normalised orig="wouldst" auto="true">would</normalised> <normalised orig="adjudg" auto="true">adjudge</normalised> Punishment, to him who hath done,
or to him who hath suffered the Injury?  BOETHPR-E3-H,183.337

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> I doubt not but that I <P_184> should
<normalised orig="adjudg" auto="true">adjudge</normalised> Satisfaction to the Sufferer, by punishing the Doer of Wrong.
BOETHPR-E3-H,184.338

<font> Ph. <$$font> The injuring Person then would seem
more miserable to thee than him who had <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> the Wrong.
BOETHPR-E3-H,184.339

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> That follows.  BOETHPR-E3-H,184.340

<font> Ph. <$$font> From this then, and from several other Reasons
founded on the same bottom, it appears, that Impiety, properly and by
its own Nature, makes Men miserable; and that an Injury done to any Man
is the Misery of the Doer, and not of the Sufferer.  BOETHPR-E3-H,184.341

But now Orators and Advocates run a Course contrary to this:
BOETHPR-E3-H,184.342

For they endeavour the Pity and Compassion of the Judges for those who
suffered any thing bitter or grievous, when the juster Pity is due to
them who did the Wrong; who should be led to Judgment, as the Sick are to
the Physician, not by angry but by merciful and compassionate Accusers;
that so they may, by the Application of Punishment, as a fit and proper
Remedy, be cured of the Malady of the Crime.  BOETHPR-E3-H,184.343

By this means the Employment of this kind of Defenders would either
wholly cease, BOETHPR-E3-H,184.344

or else, that it may be more to the Advantage of Mankind, it would be
turned into an Habit of Accusation, BOETHPR-E3-H,184.345

and would always be forward to accuse, and not to excuse ill Men:
BOETHPR-E3-H,184.346

and even those Wretches themselves, if they could through the least Hole
or Chink behold that <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> which they have forsaken, and see that they
should be in some way of cleansing <P_185> themselves from their filthy
Vices, by receiving the Pains and Torments which are due to them, they
ought, for the <normalised orig="Recompence" auto="true">Recompense</normalised> of regaining the <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> from which they have
fallen, not to esteem them so, BOETHPR-E3-H,185.347

but should <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> refuse the Defence of their Advocates, and give
themselves up wholly to their Accusers and Judges.  BOETHPR-E3-H,185.348

Hence it is that the Wise hate no Body: BOETHPR-E3-H,185.349

For who but the most foolish would hate good Men?  BOETHPR-E3-H,185.350

and it is irrational to hate the most profligate: BOETHPR-E3-H,185.351

For if a depraved Temper be, as it were, the Sickness of the Soul, since
we do not think those whose Bodies are <normalised orig="distempered" auto="true">distemper's</normalised> to be worthy of our
Hate, but rather of our Compassion, much less are those over whom Vice,
more cruel than any bodily Distemper, hath <normalised orig="gain'd" auto="true">gained</normalised> the Ascendant to be
adjudged so, BOETHPR-E3-H,185.352

but are rather to be looked upon as Subjects of our Pity.
BOETHPR-E3-H,185.353

<font> <normalised orig="PROSA" auto="true">PROSE</normalised> <$$font> VI.  BOETHPR-E3-H,190.356

<$$heading>

<font> <normalised orig="Boet" auto="true">Poet</normalised>. <$$font> So it is; BOETHPR-E3-H,190.358

but because it is thy Province to unfold the hidden Causes of things,
and to lay open those Reasons which are now <normalised orig="invelop'd" auto="true">enveloped</normalised> in Darkness, I
<normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> thee to give me thy Judgment in this Matter, and to discourse
upon it, BOETHPR-E3-H,190.359

for this Wonder troubles me very much.  BOETHPR-E3-H,190.360

Philosophy then a little smiling, said to me, O thou <normalised orig="call'st" auto="true">call</normalised> upon me
to declare to thee the greatest thing which could be asked, and which
indeed can scarce be answered: BOETHPR-E3-H,190.361

For such is the Matter of it, that one Doubt being removed,
innumerable others, like the Heads of <font> Hydra <$$font>, grow up.
BOETHPR-E3-H,190.362

Nor would there indeed be any End of them, unless they were restrained
by the Quickness and lively Fire of the Mind: BOETHPR-E3-H,190.363

For in this Matter Men are wont to make Questions of the simple <normalised orig="Actings" auto="true">Acting</normalised>
of Providence, of the Order and Course of Destiny, of sudden Chance, of
<normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised>, of Divine Predestination, and of Free-will: BOETHPR-E3-H,190.364

And of what Weight these things are, thou thy self <normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> perceive.
BOETHPR-E3-H,190.365

But because it is part of thy Medicine, <P_191> and it will contribute
much to thy Cure to know these things, although I am confined within the
narrow Bounds of Time, I shall endeavour to give thee some Taste of them.
BOETHPR-E3-H,191.366

And although the Charms and <normalised orig="Musick" auto="true">Music</normalised> of my Verse may delight thee,
yet thou must defer that Pleasure a little, whilst I in order weave
together my Reasons, which may tend to the Solution of thy Doubts.
BOETHPR-E3-H,191.367

<font> <normalised orig="Bo" auto="true">By</normalised>. <$$font> Observe thy own Method as it <normalised orig="pleaseth" auto="true">pleases</normalised> thee.
BOETHPR-E3-H,191.368

<P_191>

Then taking her Beginning as from another Principle, she thus discoursed.
BOETHPR-E3-H,191.370

<font> Ph. <$$font> The Generation of all things, and every
Progression of changeable Natures, and all things which are any way moved,
receive their Causes, Order and Forms out of the Stability or Constancy
of the Divine Mind.  BOETHPR-E3-H,191.371

And this being placed in the Height of its own Purity or Simplicity,
doth establish a manifold Mode or Way in doing things; which Mode or
Manner of Proceeding, when Men behold it in the Purity of the Divine
Understanding, is called Providence; BOETHPR-E3-H,191.372

but being <normalised orig="apply'd" auto="true">applied</normalised> and <normalised orig="referr'd" auto="true">referred</normalised> to that which it <normalised orig="moveth" auto="true">moves</normalised>, and of which it
<normalised orig="disposeth" auto="true">disposes</normalised>, it was called Fate or Destiny.  BOETHPR-E3-H,191.373

And if any one shall <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised> weigh in his Mind the Force and Energy
of the one and of the other, he shall soon find them to be different
things: BOETHPR-E3-H,191.374

For Providence is that Divine Reason settled in the chief <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised> of
the World, by which he <normalised orig="disposeth" auto="true">disposes</normalised> all things; BOETHPR-E3-H,191.375

but Fate or <P_192> Destiny is a Disposition inherent in <normalised orig="moveable" auto="true">movable</normalised>
Beings, by which Providence knits them together in their Orders.
BOETHPR-E3-H,192.376

Providence embraces and comprehends all things, although divers, although
infinite; BOETHPR-E3-H,192.377

but Fate orders and digests all single things into Motion,
BOETHPR-E3-H,192.378

and <normalised orig="distributeth" auto="true">distributes</normalised> them according to Place, Form and Time: So that the
Explication of this temporal Order being joined or folded up, in regard to
the Divine Mind, may be called Providence; and being unfolded and digested
according to Time, and the other Circumstances, it may be called Fate.
BOETHPR-E3-H,192.379

And although these things be different, yet one of them depends upon
the other; BOETHPR-E3-H,192.380

for the Order of Fate proceeds from the pure Simplicity of Providence:
BOETHPR-E3-H,192.381

For as the Artificer forming in his Mind the Shape of the thing which he
is about to make, moves to effect his Work, and doth in process of time
draw out that which before he had singly in his Imagination designed;
so God by his Providence simply and firmly doth dispose the things which
are to be done; BOETHPR-E3-H,192.382

and he doth in several Ways, and according to Time, administer by Fate
those very things which he hath so disposed.  BOETHPR-E3-H,192.383

So then, whether Fate be exercised and moved by some Divine Spirits
which attend upon Providence, or by some Soul, or by the Ministry of
the whole Body of Nature, or by the Celestial Motions of the Stars,
or by <normalised orig="Angelick" auto="true">Angelic</normalised> <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>, or by the manifold <P_193> Subtlety of Demons,
whether good or bad, or if by any of these, or if by all of them the
Series of Fate is woven: BOETHPR-E3-H,193.384

This certainly is manifest, that the immovable and simple way of doing
things is Providence; and that the movable <normalised orig="Contexture" auto="true">Conjecture</normalised> and temporal Order
of those things which the Divine Purity fore-disposed and ordered to be
done, is Fate.  BOETHPR-E3-H,193.385

Hence it is that all things which are under the Dominion of Fate,
are also subject to Providence, which commands even Fate it self.
BOETHPR-E3-H,193.386

But some things which are placed under the Guidance and Protection
of Providence, are wholly exempt from the Jurisdiction of Fate,
BOETHPR-E3-H,193.387

and surmount the Series of it; BOETHPR-E3-H,193.388

and those are such things as are <normalised orig="stably" auto="true">stable</normalised> fixed near to the Divinity,
and are above the Order of fatal Mobility.  BOETHPR-E3-H,193.389

For even as amongst several Circles turning about the same Centre, that
which is innermost <normalised orig="approacheth" auto="true">approaches</normalised> most to the Simplicity of the middle Point
, and is as it were a Centre, round which they may turn, to those placed
without it; and that which is outermost, rolling in a greater Circuit ,
the further it departs from the middle <normalised orig="Individuity" auto="true">Undivided</normalised> of the Point, so much
the more Space it doth fill; but yet if any thing should join and fasten
it self to the Point, it is constrained to be immovable, and <normalised orig="ceaseth" auto="true">cease</normalised> to
be dilated.  By parity of Reason the further any thing <normalised orig="departeth" auto="true">departs</normalised> from the
first Mind, that is from God, it is so <P_194> much the more <normalised orig="embarassed" auto="true">embarrassed</normalised>,
and faster bound in the Bonds of Destiny; BOETHPR-E3-H,194.390

and every thing is by so much the freer from Fate, by how much it
<normalised orig="approacheth" auto="true">approaches</normalised> nearer to the Centre of all things.  BOETHPR-E3-H,194.391

And if it closely adheres to the Firmness of the supreme Mind,
without moving, it goes beyond the Necessity and Power of Destiny.
BOETHPR-E3-H,194.392

As Ratiocination then is to the Intellect, as that which is begotten
is to that which hath a proper Being, as Time is to Eternity, as the
Circle is to the Centre; so is the movable Order of Fate to the stable
Simplicity of Providence.  BOETHPR-E3-H,194.393

This Order <normalised orig="moveth" auto="true">moves</normalised> the Heavens and the Stars, BOETHPR-E3-H,194.394

<normalised orig="tempereth" auto="true">tempers</normalised> the Elements, BOETHPR-E3-H,194.395

and <normalised orig="maketh" auto="true">makes</normalised> them agree amongst themselves, BOETHPR-E3-H,194.396

and by an alternative Change transforms them.  BOETHPR-E3-H,194.397

It <normalised orig="reneweth" auto="true">renews</normalised> all things which are born, and which die by the like
Progressions of Sexes and Seeds.  BOETHPR-E3-H,194.398

This binds together the Actions and Fortunes of Men by an indissoluble
Connection of Causes; which since they proceed from the <normalised orig="Origine" auto="true">Origin</normalised> of
immovable Providence, must also themselves necessarily be <normalised orig="unchangeable" auto="true">unquenchable</normalised> :
BOETHPR-E3-H,194.399

For so things are always best governed, if that pure Simplicity or
<normalised orig="Singleness" auto="true">Singling</normalised>, dwelling in the Divine Nature, may produce that unalterable
Order of Causes; BOETHPR-E3-H,194.400

for this Order, by its own <normalised orig="Unchangeableness" auto="true">Unquenchable</normalised> and Constancy, may restrain
those things which in their Nature are mutable, and which would otherwise
rashly and irregularly float about.  BOETHPR-E3-H,194.401

<P_195>

Hence it is that although things may seem confused and disturbed to Men
who $can $not {TEXT:cannot} aright consider this Order, nevertheless
the proper Manner and Course of every thing directs and <normalised orig="disposeth" auto="true">disposes</normalised> to
the true Good: BOETHPR-E3-H,195.403

For there is nothing done for the sake of Evil, BOETHPR-E3-H,195.404

no not by the most <normalised orig="flagitious" auto="true">felicitous</normalised> Wretches; who, as I have fully before
demonstrated, are in their Researches after Good diverted by crooked
Error, whilst the Order proceeding from the Centre of Sovereign Good
doth not mislead any from its Principles.  BOETHPR-E3-H,195.405

But thou <normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> say, what greater Confusion can there be, that both
prosperous and adverse things should by times happen to good Men,
and that evil Men can enjoy what their Hearts can desire, and yet be
afflicted too with things which they hate?  BOETHPR-E3-H,195.406

Do People live now <normalised orig="a-days" auto="true">adays</normalised> so <normalised orig="vertuously" auto="true">virtuously</normalised>, and with so much Integrity,
that those whom Men think good or bad, must necessarily be either?
BOETHPR-E3-H,195.407

But in this the Judgments of Men disagree much: BOETHPR-E3-H,195.408

For those whom some <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> worthy of a Reward, others think to deserve
Punishment.  BOETHPR-E3-H,195.409

But let us grant, that it is possible that some one may be able to
distinguish betwixt the Good and the Bad; BOETHPR-E3-H,195.410

Is it possible therefore that he should look into the inward
Temperament of the Mind, and pronounce of it as one may of the Body?
BOETHPR-E3-H,195.411

But it is miraculous to him who knows it not, why sweet things should be
agreeable to some Bodies, <P_196> and bitter to others; and why some sick
People are eased by Lenitives, others are helped by sharper Medicines.
BOETHPR-E3-H,196.412

But it is no wonder to the Physician, who <normalised orig="knoweth" auto="true">knows</normalised> the Measure and
Temperament of Health and Sickness.  BOETHPR-E3-H,196.413

But what other thing is it that makes the Mind healthful and strong
than Goodness?  BOETHPR-E3-H,196.414

And what is its Sickness but Vice?  BOETHPR-E3-H,196.415

Who is the Preserver of Good, and the Driver away of Evil, other than
God the great Ruler and Physician of the Mind?  BOETHPR-E3-H,196.416

who, when he looks about him from the high Observatory of his Providence
, sees and knows what is convenient for every one, and then accommodates
him with the Convenience.  BOETHPR-E3-H,196.417

Hence then proceeds that remarkable Miracle of Order of Destiny, since
the all-knowing God doth that at which the Ignorant are astonished.
BOETHPR-E3-H,196.418

But now that I may glance at a few things concerning the Depth of the
Divine <normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised>, which humane Reason may comprehend, that Man whom thou
<normalised orig="believest" auto="true">believe</normalised> to be most just, and the greatest Observer and Maintainer
of Equity, of that Man, I say, the all-knowing Providence doth think
otherwise.  BOETHPR-E3-H,196.419

And my Familiar <font> <normalised orig="Lucan" auto="true">Lichen</normalised> <$$font> told us, that the vanquishing Cause
was pleasing to the Gods, but the <normalised orig="vanquish'd" auto="true">vanquished</normalised> to <font> <normalised orig="Cato" auto="true">Cat</normalised> <$$font>
: BOETHPR-E3-H,196.420

Know this then, <P_197> that whatsoever thou <normalised orig="seest" auto="true">see</normalised> done contrary to
thy Hope or Expectation, that notwithstanding the Order of things is
preserved right and entire; BOETHPR-E3-H,197.421

but to thy perverted Opinion it <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> Confusion.  BOETHPR-E3-H,197.422

But let us suppose that a Man may have behaved himself so well, that the
Approbation of God and Man may both agree in him; but he is perhaps of
a weak Courage: so that if any thing cross should <normalised orig="befal" auto="true">befall</normalised> him, he will
forgo his Innocence, since with it he $can $not {TEXT:cannot} retain
his Fortune.  BOETHPR-E3-H,197.423

The wise Dispensation of Providence then <normalised orig="spareth" auto="true">spares</normalised> him whom Adversity may
make worse, lest he should be put to labour and travel, who is not able
to undergo such Hardship, nor to bear Afflictions.  BOETHPR-E3-H,197.424

Another Man is Master of all <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised>, BOETHPR-E3-H,197.425

is holy, and one who draws nigh to God: BOETHPR-E3-H,197.426

Providence <normalised orig="judgeth" auto="true">judges</normalised> it Injustice that that Man should be oppressed by
any Adversity; so that it will not suffer him to labour even under any
bodily Distemper: BOETHPR-E3-H,197.427

But as one more excellent than I said, {COM:greek_omitted} <font> <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised>
do build up the Body of the Holy Man <$$font>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,197.428

But it often comes to pass that good Men have the Government of <P_198>
things committed to them, that the exuberant <normalised orig="Improbity" auto="true">Improvidently</normalised> of ill Men may
be <normalised orig="repell'd" auto="true">repelled</normalised> and abated.  BOETHPR-E3-H,198.429

To some, according to the Qualities of their Minds, he gives a kind of
Mixture of Fortune, chequered with Good and Evil: BOETHPR-E3-H,198.430

Upon some he lays grievous heavy Crosses, lest they should grow luxurious
by too long a Course of Felicity: BOETHPR-E3-H,198.431

Upon others he sometimes lays also heavy Crosses, that their <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised>
may be confirmed by the Use and Exercise of Patience: BOETHPR-E3-H,198.432

Some fear more than they ought that thing which they can bear:
BOETHPR-E3-H,198.433

Others despite more than they ought that which they $can $not
{TEXT:cannot}; BOETHPR-E3-H,198.434

and those, that by the Experiment they may come to the <normalised orig="Knowledg" auto="true">Knowledge</normalised> of
themselves, he sometimes afflicts.  BOETHPR-E3-H,198.435

And many there are who have <normalised orig="purchas'd" auto="true">purchased</normalised> a great Name in the World, at the
<normalised orig="Expence" auto="true">Expense</normalised> of a glorious Death.  BOETHPR-E3-H,198.436

And some Men whose Courage hath not yielded to Torment, have given a
noble Example to others, that <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised> is not to be overcome by Adversity.
BOETHPR-E3-H,198.437

And there is no doubt but that all these things are done justly
and in order, and for the Good of those to whom they happen.
BOETHPR-E3-H,198.438

It also proceeds from the said Causes that sometimes Adversity, sometimes
Prosperity, comes to be the Lot of ill Men.  BOETHPR-E3-H,198.439

And it is the Wonder of no Man, that <normalised orig="flagitious" auto="true">felicitous</normalised> Persons should be
afflicted, because they are always thought to deserve what comes upon
them; and that their <P_199> Punishment doth deter others from such
Aims, and often work a Reformation in those on whom they are inflicted :
BOETHPR-E3-H,199.440

But the Prosperity of such yields a great Argument to the Good,
BOETHPR-E3-H,199.441

and directs them what to <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> of this kind of Happiness, which they so
often see to fall to the share of the worst of Men.  In which thing I
think often there is a Dispensation, because the Nature of some Men may
be so forward and importunate, that Poverty, and the want of Necessaries,
would rather urge them to do ill.  BOETHPR-E3-H,199.442

But this Disease Providence doth cure by applying the powerful Medicine
of Money.  BOETHPR-E3-H,199.443

One Man finding his Conscience deeply spotted with Crimes, and comparing
himself and his Fortune, fears perhaps that the Happiness which he
enjoyed by the Use of it, should be wholly done away by its Loss;
BOETHPR-E3-H,199.444

he will therefore change his Manners, BOETHPR-E3-H,199.445

and whilst he fears to lose his Estate he will leave his Impiety.
BOETHPR-E3-H,199.446

Upon another Happiness is <normalised orig="conferr'd" auto="true">conferred</normalised> without Desert, BOETHPR-E3-H,199.447

and that precipitates him into a merited Destruction.
BOETHPR-E3-H,199.448

To some there is a Power of Punishing granted, that it may exercise
the <normalised orig="Vertues" auto="true">Virtues</normalised> of the Good, and may be Cause of Punishments and Torment to
the Evil.  BOETHPR-E3-H,199.449

For as there is no Covenant or Agreement betwixt the <normalised orig="Vertuous" auto="true">Virtuous</normalised> and
the Wicked, so neither can wretched Men agree amongst themselves.
BOETHPR-E3-H,199.450

And why should they?  BOETHPR-E3-H,199.451

for they disagree amongst themselves by reason <P_200> of their Vices,
which rend and tear the Conscience; BOETHPR-E3-H,200.452

and they often do those things, which when they are over, they <normalised orig="judg" auto="true">judge</normalised> they
ought not to have done them.  From whence Providence hath often produced
a signal Miracle, to wit, that evil Men have oft made other ill Men good:
BOETHPR-E3-H,200.453

For when some of these find that they have suffered an Injury from others
of them urged by the Hate of those that have offended them, they have
returned to the Ways of <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>, studying nothing more than {they_studied}
to be unlike to those Persons whom they hate.  BOETHPR-E3-H,200.454

It is only the great Power of God which can make Evil turn to Good,
when by using them agreeably and conveniently he draws out of them the
Effect of some Good: BOETHPR-E3-H,200.455

For a certain Order <normalised orig="embraceth" auto="true">embraces</normalised> all Beings, so that whatsoever doth depart
from the Reason and Laws of that Order which is assigned to it, yet it
<normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> into and under the Laws of another Order; BOETHPR-E3-H,200.456

for nothing is left in the Power of Chance or Uncertainty in the Realm
of Providence.  BOETHPR-E3-H,200.457

{COM:greek_omitted} <font> It is hard for me to express how God rules
and <normalised orig="disposeth" auto="true">disposes</normalised> all things by his Providence <$$font>.  BOETHPR-E3-H,200.458

Nor is it lawful for a Man <paren> if he could <$$paren> to comprehend
all the Machines and Movements of the Divine Work, even in his Thought,
much less to declare and describe them in Words.  BOETHPR-E3-H,200.459

Let it suffice to have seen only this, that God, the Framer of all
Natures, <P_201> orders and <normalised orig="disposeth" auto="true">disposes</normalised> every thing towards Good;
BOETHPR-E3-H,201.460

and whilst he endeavours to retain those things which he hath made
in his own Likeness, he <normalised orig="banisheth" auto="true">banishes</normalised> all Evil by the Course of Destiny,
without the Bounds of his Commonwealth.  BOETHPR-E3-H,201.461

Hence it is that if thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> but regard the all-disposing Providence,
thou <normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> easily see, that there are not those Evils which Men believe
do abound upon the Face of the Earth.  BOETHPR-E3-H,201.462

But now I see that thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> almost lie down under the Weight and
Prolixity of my Reasoning; and that thou <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> expect the <normalised orig="Musick" auto="true">Music</normalised> of my
Verse: BOETHPR-E3-H,201.463

receive then this Draught with which when thou art <normalised orig="refresh'd" auto="true">refreshed</normalised>, thou
<normalised orig="mayst" auto="true">may</normalised> more strongly proceed to other Matters which yet remain.
BOETHPR-E3-H,201.464
