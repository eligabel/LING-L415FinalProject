WHEN THE <normalised orig="SCHOLLER" auto="true">SCHOLAR</normalised> SHOULD FIRST BE SET TO THE <normalised orig="SCHOOLE" auto="true">SCHOOL</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,8.5

<$$heading>

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> That I may begin at the very first entrance
of the <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised>: let me inquire this of you, how soon you would have your
<normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> set unto the <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised>; BRINSLEY-E2-H,8.7

for I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> that worthy to be first <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, if so be that you purpose to
have your <normalised orig="scholler" auto="true">scholar</normalised> fitted for the <normalised orig="Universitie" auto="true">University</normalised>, by <normalised orig="fifteene" auto="true">fifteen</normalised> <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> of age.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,8.8

<font> Phil. <$$font> I like your reason well, to enter there.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,8.9

But to the intent that I may more fully make <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> unto you, what I
<normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised>, and have found in this <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised>, let <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> first of you,
as I wished in <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, at what age you use in your <normalised orig="countrey" auto="true">country</normalised>, to set
your children to begin to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,8.10

<P_9>

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> For the time of their entrance with us,
in our <normalised orig="countrey" auto="true">country</normalised> <normalised orig="schooles" auto="true">schools</normalised>, it is commonly about seven or eight <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>
old: BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.12

<normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> is very <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.13

If any <normalised orig="beginne" auto="true">begin</normalised> so early, they are rather sent to the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> them
from troubling the house at home, and from danger, and shrewd <normalised orig="turnes" auto="true">turns</normalised>,
then for any great hope and desire their friends have that they should
<normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> any thing in effect.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.14

<font> Phil. <$$font> I <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> that therein first is a very great
want generally; for that the child, if <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> be of any ordinary <normalised orig="towardnesse" auto="true">towardness</normalised>
and <normalised orig="capacitie" auto="true">capacity</normalised>, should begin at five <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> old at the uttermost, or
sooner rather.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.15

My reasons are these: BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.16

1.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.17

Because that then children will begin to conceive of instruction, and
to understand; and bee able not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to know their letters, to spell
and to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>, but also to take a delight therein, and to strive to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>
before their <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.18

Experience <normalised orig="heerein" auto="true">herein</normalised> will <normalised orig="quickely" auto="true">quickly</normalised> teach every one, who shall make <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised>
of it, if so be that they doe follow a right course.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.19

2.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.20

Very reason must needs <normalised orig="perswade" auto="true">persuade</normalised> every one of this.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.21

For, if they bee apt much before five <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> of age, to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>
<normalised orig="shrewdnesse" auto="true">shrewdness</normalised>, and those things which are <normalised orig="hurtfull" auto="true">hurtful</normalised>, which they must bee
taught to <normalised orig="unlearne" auto="true">unlearn</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; why are they not as well fit to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> those
things which are good and profitable for them, if they be <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> and
<normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised> on in such a manner, as they may take a delight and <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> a <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>
of sport and play in the same?  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.22

This delight may and ought to be in all their <normalised orig="progresse" auto="true">progress</normalised>, and most of all
in their first entrance, to make them the better to love the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised>,
and learning, as we shall see after.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.23

3.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.24

Many of them doe <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> so much <normalised orig="untowardnesse" auto="true">untowardness</normalised> and <normalised orig="naughtinesse" auto="true">naughtiness</normalised> amongst
other rude children, in that time before they come to <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised>, that they
are worse for it continually after: BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.25

and also they <normalised orig="feele" auto="true">feel</normalised> such <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised> in play and <normalised orig="idlenesse" auto="true">idleness</normalised>, as they can
hardly bee framed to leave it, and to take a delight in their <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised>
without very much <normalised orig="adoe" auto="true">ado</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,9.26

<P_10>

4.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.28

This first age is that wherein they are most pliant, and may bee <normalised orig="bended" auto="true">banded</normalised>
and fashioned most easily to any good course.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.29

And being thus accustomed to good things from their <normalised orig="infancie" auto="true">infancy</normalised>, and kept
so much as may be, from all practice and sight of <normalised orig="evill" auto="true">evil</normalised>, <normalised orig="custome" auto="true">custom</normalised> becomes
unto them another nature.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.30

So great a thing it is <paren> according to the old <normalised orig="proverbe" auto="true">proverb</normalised> <$$paren>
to <normalised orig="accustome" auto="true">accustom</normalised> children, even from their tender <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>; BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.31

and so undoubtedly true is that common verse, <normalised orig="Quo" auto="true">Qua</normalised> <normalised orig="semel" auto="true">simile</normalised> est <normalised orig="imbuta" auto="true">imbued</normalised> <normalised orig="recens" auto="true">resins</normalised>
<normalised orig="seruabit" auto="true">servant</normalised> <normalised orig="odorem" auto="true">adorn</normalised> <normalised orig="testa" auto="true">taste</normalised> <normalised orig="diu" auto="true">dive</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.32

5.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.33

Above all these is a <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> benefit, that by this <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> two or
three <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> may well be gained, to fit your <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> so much sooner
for the <normalised orig="Universitie" auto="true">University</normalised>, or for any honest trade or calling.  So that a
child thus <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> rightly, shall doe much more at eight <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> old, then
another so neglected can doe at ten, or it may bee at eleven or twelve.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.34

Also many such shall be <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> for trades and like <normalised orig="imployments" auto="true">employments</normalised>, when they
have no learning to fit them <normalised orig="thereunto" auto="true">torrent</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.35

This must needs be a great <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> to the Parents of such, whose children
have so lost their time, as it is a joy to others whose children have
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> so well brought up, when they see their children compared together.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.36

6.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.37

Lastly, our time being so short, it much <normalised orig="concerneth" auto="true">concerns</normalised> every parent,
to see their children to have the best education and instruction,
which is the <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> <normalised orig="patrimonie" auto="true">patrimony</normalised>, and the greatest comfort and hope both
of the Parents and Children, and also of their houses and <normalised orig="posteritie" auto="true">posterity</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.38

And this so <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as ever may bee, to fit them for some profitable
<normalised orig="imploiment" auto="true">employment</normalised> for Church or Common-wealth.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.39

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> But they will say with us, that it will
hinder the growth of their children to be set to <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> so young.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.40

<font> Phil. <$$font> Let the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> be made unto them a place
of play: and the children drawn on by that pleasant delight which ought
to be, it can then no more hinder their growth then their play doth,
but rather further it, when they sit at their ease; BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.41

besides that <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> experience doth confute this <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,10.42

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> Bee it so as you say: yet this is a
received opinion, <P_11> that it will cause them to hate the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised>,
<normalised orig="whe~" auto="true">whew</normalised> they should be set to it in good earnest.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.43

<font> Phil. <$$font> Nay rather it is clean contrary:
BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.44

for being acquainted with the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> so young, and with the sport and
pleasure which they <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> amongst other children there; and also being
kept from feeling the overmuch <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised> in play, it shall cause them
to love & to delight in the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> continually, and to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> on without
any <normalised orig="repining" auto="true">ripening</normalised>, or so much as thinking of being away from the <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised>:
whereas they being <normalised orig="nuzled" auto="true">nuzzled</normalised> up in play abroad, are very hardly reclaimed and
weaned from it, to <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> to their <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.45

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> But yet it is thought that they can get
but little learning then, being so very young, and therefore there is
the smaller <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of a <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised> or two, at that time.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.46

<font> Phil. <$$font> The <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> will bee found in the end,
although it bee indeed in the beginning.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.47

For <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> how many <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised> they lose in the beginning if they bee apt,
so many in the end they will bee shorter, of such of their <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>, who
are but of their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> age, and applied all alike being of like <normalised orig="capacitie" auto="true">capacity</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.48

Therefore, as wee will not let them lose a day, when they grove towards
the <normalised orig="Universitie" auto="true">University</normalised>, so neither should we when they are young; but prevent
this <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised>, and take the time in the beginning.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.49

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> We see notwithstanding some very long
ere ever they begin, who then <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward with it the fastest of all.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.50

<font> Phil. <$$font> It is true in some pregnant wits, and who
are industrious: BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.51

but you shall have others as <normalised orig="blockish" auto="true">blackish</normalised> and dull.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.52

Also, for those, if they go so fast in the rudiments & first grounds ,
how much more would they doe so at the same time in better studies?
BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.53

Neither can they have <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> that learning in all things, which others
of like age and <normalised orig="aptnesse" auto="true">aptness</normalised> have, who have been well <normalised orig="applyed" auto="true">applied</normalised> from their
first <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.54

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> I <normalised orig="yeeld" auto="true">yield</normalised> to all which you have said in this
<normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised>; BRINSLEY-E2-H,11.55

and I doe see <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised> the exceeding benefits, that must needs come
hereby, especially in gaining of time; if they may bee <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> in that
playing manner, and <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward <P_12> with <normalised orig="alacritie" auto="true">alacrity</normalised> and contention;
and moreover so, that they bee not any way overloaded or discouraged,
nor yet <normalised orig="indangered" auto="true">endangered</normalised>, by the overcharging of their wits and memories.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.56

<font> Phil. <$$font> For that take you no <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>;
BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.57

you shall <paren> God willing <$$paren> see the evidence of that, and
a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> direction in every Chapter, how to <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> in that <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> and
playing <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.58

Therefore, if you be satisfied in this, let us come unto the next point.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.59

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> Very gladly Sir: BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.60

for I long to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> this, how you would teach your child being so <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised>,
to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> so soon and readily.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.61

<font> Phil. <$$font> I like the point well: BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.62

proceed according to your order.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.63

CHAP. III.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.65

HOW THE <normalised orig="SCHOLLER" auto="true">SCHOLAR</normalised> MAY BE TAUGHT TO <normalised orig="READE" auto="true">READ</normalised> ENGLISH SPEEDILY, TO FIT HIM
THE SOONER, AND BETTER FOR THE GRAMMAR <normalised orig="SCHOOLE" auto="true">SCHOOL</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.66

<$$heading>

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> Before wee enter into this question, let
me put you in <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised> of one thing, which doth much trouble <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> concerning
this very matter.  That it <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> to <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> an unreasonable thing, that the
Grammar <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised> should bee troubled with teaching A. B.
C. seeing it is so great a <normalised orig="hinderance" auto="true">hindrance</normalised> to those <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> which wee
should take with our Grammar <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised>, for whom wee are appointed:
Because it doth take up almost one <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> of our time, and thereby doth
deprive us of a <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> part of the fruit of our labours; especially when
our <normalised orig="mindes" auto="true">minds</normalised> are so distracted, and our thoughts carried so many <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>,
to doe good to all.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,12.68

The very little ones in a <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised>, in most <normalised orig="countrey" auto="true">country</normalised> <normalised orig="townes" auto="true">towns</normalised> which are
of any <normalised orig="bignesse" auto="true">bigness</normalised>, <P_13> would require a whole man, of themselves, to
bee <normalised orig="alwaies" auto="true">always</normalised> hearing, <normalised orig="poasing" auto="true">poising</normalised> & following them, so as they ought to be
<normalised orig="applyed" auto="true">applied</normalised>: BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.69

for <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> applying in a right course, is in this and all other
parts of learning, above all other <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.70

And young ones, by a little slaking our hands, run faster <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised>
, then ever they went forward; as <normalised orig="boates" auto="true">boats</normalised> going up the <normalised orig="streame" auto="true">stream</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.71

Besides, it is an extreme vexation, that we must be toiled amongst such
little petties, and in teaching such matters, whereof wee can get no
profit, nor take any delight in our labours.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.72

<font> Phil. <$$font> I am well inured with this grievance,
which you <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of, BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.73

and doe know by long experience your complaint to bee just in this
<normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.74

I <normalised orig="myselfe" auto="true">myself</normalised> have complained of it many a time.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.75

For it were much to be wished, that none might bee admitted to the
Grammar <normalised orig="schooles" auto="true">schools</normalised>, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> they were able to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> English: as namely,
that they could <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> the New Testament perfectly, and that they were
in their <normalised orig="Accidences" auto="true">Hesitancy's</normalised>, or meet to enter into them.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.76

There might bee some other <normalised orig="schoole" auto="true">school</normalised> in the <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised>, for these little ones
to enter them.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.77

It would <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> some <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> man or woman, who knew not how to live
otherwise, and who might doe that well, if they were rightly directed.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.78

Also it would be such an ease to all Grammar <normalised orig="Schoolemasters" auto="true">Schoolmasters</normalised>, as they might
doe much more good in their places.  Wherefore, all such <normalised orig="Schoolemasters" auto="true">Schoolmasters</normalised>
who are <normalised orig="incumbered" auto="true">encumbered</normalised> with this inconvenience, are not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to wish,
but also to labour to have it reformed in their <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="schooles" auto="true">schools</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.79

Yet notwithstanding, where it $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be redressed
, it must be borne with <normalised orig="wisdome" auto="true">wisdom</normalised> and patience as an heavy burden.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.80

Patience shall make it much more light.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.81

And therefore every one is to doe his best <normalised orig="indeavour" auto="true">endeavour</normalised>, to know how to
make it most <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised>, if it doe lie upon him.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,13.82

Moreover, seeing we purpose, God willing, to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> <normalised orig="thorow" auto="true">thorough</normalised> all the whole
course of learning, and also <normalised orig="sith" auto="true">sid</normalised> our labour is to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> out the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>,
whereby to make the way <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised>, to <normalised orig="traine" auto="true">train</normalised> up every <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> from the very
first entrance into learning, <paren> as was said <$$paren> <P_14> <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised>
wee have brought him into the <normalised orig="Universitie" auto="true">University</normalised>, we $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
omit any point, which may tend unto the $same {TEXT:fame} , much <normalised orig="lesse" auto="true">less</normalised>
the first steppe of all.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.83

For, a child well <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> is <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> made: according to that <normalised orig="Proverbe" auto="true">Proverb</normalised>,
<normalised orig="Principium" auto="true">Permissiveness</normalised>, <normalised orig="dimidium" auto="true">demotion</normalised> <normalised orig="totius" auto="true">tot's</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.84

The foundation well <normalised orig="layd" auto="true">laid</normalised>, the building must needs <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward much
more happily.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.85

This is specially true in learning; wherein children feeling a <normalised orig="sweetnesse" auto="true">sweetness</normalised>
in the beginning, are very much <normalised orig="incouraged" auto="true">encouraged</normalised>, as daily experience will
manifest to every one.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.86

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> I see well the <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised> of undergoing
this burden, in those places where remedy $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be had,
without greater inconveniences.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.87

And therefore, <normalised orig="sith" auto="true">sid</normalised> that <normalised orig="necessitie" auto="true">necessity</normalised> hath no law, nor for <normalised orig="myselfe" auto="true">myself</normalised> I know
no <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> how to bee freed from it; I pray you let us <normalised orig="returne" auto="true">return</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>
unto the point, BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.88

and let <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> still <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> of you your best direction, to make this burden
so light as may bee.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.89

This is a thing worth the diligence of all, who must be <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> amongst
little ones: to wit, to teach children how to read well, and to pronounce
their letters truly; as also to spell right, and to know how to write
true Orthography in a short space.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.90

For <paren> that I may acknowledge the truth, and which hath bin no
small discredit unto <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> in this <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised> <$$paren> I have had some who
have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> with me, two or three <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, before they could <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> well.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.91

And that which hath yet been much more grievous to me.  I have sometimes
<normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> so abashed and ashamed, that I have not <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> what to say, when
some being a little discontented, or taking occasion to quarrel about
paying my stipend, have cast this in my teeth, that their children have
been under me <normalised orig="sixe" auto="true">six</normalised> or seven <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, and yet have not learned to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>
English well.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.92

I <normalised orig="myselfe" auto="true">myself</normalised> have also <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, that their complaints have been true in part
; though I have taken all the <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised> with them that ever I could devise.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.93

Therefore good Sir, set <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> as <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised> and shortly as you can, how
this may be helped.  Both <normalised orig="myselfe" auto="true">myself</normalised> and many other <normalised orig="shal" auto="true">shall</normalised> be much beholden
for your direction in this first entrance.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,14.94

For my <normalised orig="maner" auto="true">manner</normalised> of <normalised orig="entring" auto="true">entering</normalised> them, it is that which I take to be everywhere:
to teach & <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> them <P_15> so oft over <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> they can say a lesson,
and so to a new.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.95

<font> Phil. <$$font> I likewise have been well acquainted with
this your trouble: BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.96

and therefore I will <normalised orig="indevour" auto="true">endeavour</normalised>, to afford you so much as I have yet
learned, how to avoid these clamours; and how any <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> man who
will <normalised orig="imploy" auto="true">employ</normalised> his <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised>, may learn to teach children to read well
in a short time, though this may <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised> unbefitting our profession.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.97

First the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> is to be taught, how to call every letter, pronouncing
each of them <normalised orig="plainely" auto="true">plainly</normalised>, fully and distinctly; I <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised>, in a distinct and
differing sound, each from others, and also naturally, from the very
first entrance to learning.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.98

More specially to bee <normalised orig="carefull" auto="true">careful</normalised>, for the right pronouncing the five vowels,
in the first place, as <font> a, e, i, o, u <$$font>.  Because these are
first and most <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised>, and doe make a perfect sound, so that they may
bee pronounced fully of themselves; BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.99

and they being rightly uttered, all the rest are more <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.100

After these vowels, to teach them to pronounce every other letter : which
are therefore called Consonants, because they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} make
a perfect sound of themselves, without a <normalised orig="Vowell" auto="true">Vowel</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.101

This may be done, and also the teaching of children to spell any syllable
, before the child do know any letter on the <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>; BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.102

and that, some wise and experienced doe hold the surest and best course.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.103

But they are, at least, to be taught to pronounce their letters thus ,
as they doe <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> them; to prevent the <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> and <normalised orig="wearisomnesse" auto="true">wearisomeness</normalised> of
teaching them to forget evil <normalised orig="customes" auto="true">customs</normalised> in pronouncing, which they <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised>
up in their first ill learning.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.104

And so ever in teaching to read, the teachers are to continue the like
care of sweet and <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised> pronunciation.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.105

Secondly, for the knowing of the letters <paren> besides that common
manner practised in <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised>, which is by oft reading over all the
letters forwards and backwards <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> they can say them <$$paren> they
may be much furthered thus; That is, by causing the <normalised orig="childe" auto="true">child</normalised> to find out
, and to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> you which is <font> a <$$font>, which <font> b <$$font> ,
which <font> c <$$font>, which <font> f <$$font>, and so any other letter.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.106

First to <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> them in the Alphabet, then in any other place.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,15.107

<P_16>

Or if you will let them <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> but one letter at once, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> they
can readily know or <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> out that letter in any place, and after that
another in the same manner: BRINSLEY-E2-H,16.109

This is holden the surer and more <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> way: BRINSLEY-E2-H,16.110

But this at your <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> judgement.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,16.111

CHAP. V.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.114

OF <normalised orig="CERTAINE" auto="true">CERTAIN</normalised> <normalised orig="GENERALL" auto="true">GENERAL</normalised> OBSERVATIONS TO BEE <normalised orig="KNOWNE" auto="true">KNOWN</normalised> OF <normalised orig="SCHOOLE-MASTERS" auto="true">SCHOOLMASTERS</normalised>
, AND PRACTISED CAREFULLY IN ALL GRAMMAR LEARNING <normalised orig="CHIEFELY" auto="true">CHIEFLY</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.115

AND FIRST, OF CAUSING ALL THINGS TO BE DONE WITH UNDERSTANDING.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.116

<$$heading>

<font> Phil. <$$font> For the <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> Observations, the first
may be this: 1. That <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> be taught to do all things with
understanding; and to be able to give a reason of every matter which
they <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.118

And so in every lecture which they <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> in any tongue, first to
understand the matter of it, BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.119

and the lesson will be learned presently.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.120

But before I <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> any more of this, I pray you let me <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> of you
what course you have taken in this point.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.121

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> This first observation <normalised orig="seemeth" auto="true">seems</normalised> strange
unto me, at the very naming of it.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.122

I my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> have used <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> this course, BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.123

and I <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> it to be all that is done in most of our <normalised orig="countrey" auto="true">country</normalised> <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised>;
To give Lectures to the <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised>, or cause some <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> to do it.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.124

And therein first to <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> them over their Lecture, then to construe them,
and in the lower <normalised orig="formes" auto="true">forms</normalised> to parse them.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.125

So when they come to say; to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> them whether they can <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>, say
without <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, construe and parse.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.126

More, as I take it, is not much used, for the understanding and making
use of them.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.127

<font> Phil. <$$font> I know it to be as you say;
BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.128

and do hold it to be a <normalised orig="verie" auto="true">very</normalised> great defect in <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised> generally: yea a
<normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> greater <normalised orig="hinderance" auto="true">hindrance</normalised> to learning, then that of letting them to lose
so many <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, before they begin to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,41.129

For this is a matter which of all other <normalised orig="concerneth" auto="true">concerns</normalised> the credit of <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised>
, and <normalised orig="furthereth" auto="true">furthered</normalised> learning wonderfully; to teach <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> to understand
whatsoever they <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>, and to be <P_42> able to give a reason of every
thing why it is so; and to doe this from the lowest to the highest.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.130

My reasons are these: BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.131

1.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.132

Because if it were rightly <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised>, and constantly practised in <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised>,
it would bring forth very <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> double so much good and sound learning,
as is now gotten <normalised orig="co~monly" auto="true">commonly</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.133

2.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.134

It would bring <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised>, so much ease, pleasure and delight, both to all
teachers and learners, and also so much <normalised orig="certainety" auto="true">certainty</normalised>, and cause them to
go forward with such <normalised orig="cheerefulnesse" auto="true">cheerfulness</normalised>, <normalised orig="boldnesse" auto="true">boldness</normalised> and contention , as will
hardly be <normalised orig="beleeved" auto="true">believed</normalised> <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> it be tried by experience.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.135

In a word; it would cause all things to be gotten much more
speedily, <normalised orig="layed" auto="true">laid</normalised> up more safely, and kept more surely in memory.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.136

Therefore, that old rule is true; <normalised orig="Legere" auto="true">Lager</normalised> & non <normalised orig="intelligere" auto="true">la</normalised> negligere est.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.137

To <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> and not to understand what we <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised>, or not to know how to
make use of it, is nothing else but a neglect of all good learning
, and a <normalised orig="meere" auto="true">mere</normalised> abuse of the <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> and helps to <normalised orig="attaine" auto="true">attain</normalised> the same.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.138

It is no other thing but a very <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of our precious time, and of all
our labour and cost bestowed therein, in regard of that which is read
with understanding.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.139

We may see <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> here of sundry <normalised orig="wayes" auto="true">ways</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.140

1.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.141

Let children be examined together; I <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> such as of whom one of them
alone hath <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> taught to do all things by reason and with understanding
; so that he is able to give you a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> reason, and make the right use
of every thing, which he hath learned: the other have learned <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> to
say without <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>, to construe and parse; BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.142

then <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> the difference.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.143

Although all these <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> one and the same Author; yet when they come
to the <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised>, you would <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> that one to have all learning, when
you <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> him to give a reason of every thing, and that he can make use
of all things; all the rest to have almost nothing at all, or at least
nothing in regard of that one so taught.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.144

2.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.145

Prove it thus in getting learning.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.146

Teach your <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> one lesson which you cause him to understand perfectly
before: another of the same matter, whereof he <normalised orig="understandeth" auto="true">understands</normalised> little or
nothing; BRINSLEY-E2-H,42.147

and then <normalised orig="trie" auto="true">try</normalised> <P_43> whether he will not do that, whereof he <normalised orig="understandeth" auto="true">understands</normalised>
the meaning and reasons, almost in <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> the time, which the other
will require.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.148

And this also so, as you may evidently <normalised orig="discerne" auto="true">discern</normalised> it, that he will do it
with much more ease, <normalised orig="certainety" auto="true">certainty</normalised> and <normalised orig="boldnesse" auto="true">boldness</normalised>, then {with} he can do
the other.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.149

3.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.150

We our selves may make <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of it by our <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> experience, in construing
any difficult piece of <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, <normalised orig="Greeke" auto="true">Greek</normalised>, or Hebrew, or committing any thing
to <normalised orig="memorie" auto="true">memory</normalised>; whether if so be that we do but understand the matter of it
before perfectly, we shall not do it in <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised> the time, and with one <normalised orig="halfe" auto="true">half</normalised>
of the labour, that otherwise it would require.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.151

Or if we would write or <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of any thing, let us prove it but thus:
If we first understand the matter well, and have it perfectly in our head
, whether words to <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> our minds will not follow as of themselves.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.152

To this very purpose, for confirming the truth hereof, and to <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised>
a <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> remembrance of this point; these three verses of <font>
Horace <$$font> were worthy to be written in letters of gold, and to be
imprinted in the <normalised orig="memorie" auto="true">memory</normalised> of every one who is desirous to get the best
learning: BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.153

for so they would <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> prove golden verses, and make undoubtedly golden
times; Scribendi <normalised orig="recte" auto="true">react</normalised> <normalised orig="sapere" auto="true">caper</normalised> est & <normalised orig="principium" auto="true">permissiveness</normalised> & <normalised orig="fons" auto="true">foins</normalised>: <normalised orig="Rem" auto="true">Ream</normalised> <normalised orig="tibi" auto="true">tibia</normalised> <normalised orig="Socraticae" auto="true">Socrates</normalised>
<normalised orig="poterunt" auto="true">paternity</normalised> <normalised orig="ostendere" auto="true">estimators</normalised> <normalised orig="chartae" auto="true">charade</normalised>; <normalised orig="Verbaque" auto="true">Verbiage</normalised> <normalised orig="prouisam" auto="true">prism</normalised> <normalised orig="rem" auto="true">ream</normalised> non <normalised orig="inuita" auto="true">inuit</normalised> <normalised orig="sequentur" auto="true">squinter</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.154

The meaning of the verses, I take it to be this: BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.155

To <normalised orig="attaine" auto="true">attain</normalised> to this <normalised orig="facultie" auto="true">faculty</normalised>, to be able to write or <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> of any matter
, and so to come to all excellent learning, the very first and <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised>
<normalised orig="fountaine" auto="true">fountain</normalised>, and that which is all in all, is to understand the matter
well in the first place.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.156

As for store of matter, the writings of learned men <paren> such as <font>
<normalised orig="Socrates" auto="true">Secretes</normalised> <$$font> was <$$paren> will furnish you abundantly therewith.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.157

And when you have the matter thoroughly in your head, words will follow,
as waters out of a <normalised orig="Fountaine" auto="true">Fountain</normalised>, even almost naturally, to <normalised orig="expresse" auto="true">express</normalised> your mind
in any tongue, which you <normalised orig="studie" auto="true">study</normalised> in any right order.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,43.158

<P_44>

This will be found to be true in <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>, <normalised orig="Greeke" auto="true">Greek</normalised>, Hebrew, and by a
like reason in every other tongue, and in every <normalised orig="facultie" auto="true">faculty</normalised>: whether we
would write, <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised>, <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>, resolve, or remember and lay up for ever.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.160

This was a <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> cause that made <font> <normalised orig="Tully" auto="true">Tally</normalised>, <normalised orig="Ovid" auto="true">Ovoid</normalised>, <normalised orig="Virgil" auto="true">Virgule</normalised>
<$$font>, and some others so to flow in eloquence; and especially <font>
<normalised orig="Virgil" auto="true">Virgule</normalised> <$$font>, whom men worthily account the <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> of all <normalised orig="Latine" auto="true">Latin</normalised>
Poets, because they did understand so fully whatsoever they writ of.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.161

I might instance this also in Preachers, by our daily experience; of
whom some are better able to preach powerfully in two <normalised orig="dayes" auto="true">days</normalised> warning,
and having words at will, then other {are_able_to_do_so} in two <normalised orig="moneths" auto="true">months</normalised>
; BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.162

and all because the one sort are so full of understanding and matter,
the other are so barren thereof.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.163

Thus in all these examples, every man may see a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> demonstration of
the truth of these verses of <font> Horace <$$font>, which he no doubt
did write upon his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> experience, as every man shall find, who <normalised orig="wil" auto="true">will</normalised>
set <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> to make <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.164

Prove and <normalised orig="confirme" auto="true">confirm</normalised> what tongue <normalised orig="soever" auto="true">sever</normalised> your <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> <normalised orig="learnes" auto="true">learns</normalised>, even from
the first reading of English, BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.165

if he can <normalised orig="repeate" auto="true">repeat</normalised> you the matter, or the <normalised orig="summe" auto="true">sum</normalised> of it, or have it
in his head, <normalised orig="trie" auto="true">try</normalised> whether he will not have the words presently.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.166

The <normalised orig="plentifull" auto="true">plentiful</normalised> experience which I have <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised>, of the <normalised orig="sweete" auto="true">sweet</normalised> delight
and <normalised orig="fruite" auto="true">fruit</normalised> of this course, of causing children to do all things with
understanding and reason, compared with the <normalised orig="fruitlesse" auto="true">fruitless</normalised> <normalised orig="toyles" auto="true">toils</normalised> and <normalised orig="griefes" auto="true">griefs</normalised>
of former times, do make me not <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> confident for the thing, but also
desirous to make all other partakers of the benefit.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.167

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> I do fully see the evidence of all that
which you have said, BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.168

and therefore I must needs be <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> of it.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.169

I do heartily <normalised orig="thanke" auto="true">thank</normalised> God for it, BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.170

and will <normalised orig="endevor" auto="true">endeavour</normalised> <normalised orig="myselfe" auto="true">myself</normalised> to put it in practise continually.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.171

Only here is the difficulty, how a <normalised orig="Schoolemaster" auto="true">Schoolmaster</normalised> may do this, to teach
his <normalised orig="Scholler" auto="true">Scholar</normalised> so to <normalised orig="proceede" auto="true">proceed</normalised> with understanding, and how to give a reason
of every matter which they <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>, to make use of all their learning.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,44.172

Above all, how <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> may <normalised orig="beginne" auto="true">begin</normalised> to fraught young <P_45> <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> with
all store of matter, as they <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> on: BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.173

this very much <normalised orig="passeth" auto="true">passes</normalised> my skill.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.174

I should <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> most happy, to <normalised orig="obtaine" auto="true">obtain</normalised> this knowledge, if it
possibly can be done.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.175

<font> Phil. <$$font> Attend to those things which I shall relate
, and I have no doubt, but I shall very much accomplish your desire in
this: BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.176

for our whole conference doth tend <normalised orig="chiefely" auto="true">chiefly</normalised> to this end.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.177

As all learning is grounded on reason: so in every Chapter I shall
endeavour my <normalised orig="selfe" auto="true">self</normalised> to manifest the reasons of every thing, and how you
may teach others; so <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> forth, as hither to the Lord hath made them
<normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> unto me.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.178

And more hereafter, as I shall <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> more.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.179

The <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> for their understanding, is, by asking short
questions of the matter: BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.180

for so they will understand any thing, which they are to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.181

But of that more hereafter in the particular examples; and chiefly,
Chap. 23.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.182

<font> <normalised orig="Spoud" auto="true">Spout</normalised>. <$$font> If you have done then with this, let us
<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> forward to your next <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> observation; and so <normalised orig="thorow" auto="true">thorough</normalised> them all,
as briefly as you can.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.183

<font> Phil. <$$font> My next observation is this: that as
I would have them to do all things with understanding; so to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>
<normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> such <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> and matters, as whereof they may have the best use,
BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.184

and that perpetually in all their learning, or in their whole life.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.185

For this is well <normalised orig="knowne" auto="true">known</normalised> to every one; that things well learned in youth
, will be kept most surely all the life long; because in that age they
are most easily imprinted, and <normalised orig="sticke" auto="true">stick</normalised> the longest in fresh memory.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.186

And for that cause, children should spend no time <normalised orig="unfruitfully" auto="true">unfruitful</normalised> in such
<normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised>, as whereof they $can $not {TEXT:cannot} have both very good and
<normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> use.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.187

This $can $not {TEXT:cannot} be but a great folly, to <normalised orig="mis-spend" auto="true">misspend</normalised> our
precious time in such studies, whereof neither our selves nor others
can have benefit after; or else in such, as the knowledge whereof will
vanish for want of practise: and much more in those, which will corrupt
and hurt in stead of doing good.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.188

And therefore all filthy places in the Poets would be wisely passed over,
or wearily expounded.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.189

It were well if there were an Index <normalised orig="Expurgatorius" auto="true">Expurgation's</normalised>, to purge out
all the filth out of these by leaving it out, or changing it.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,45.190

<P_46>

Third rule, and that <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> for all Students, is this: that whatsoever
difficult words, or matters of <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> observation, they do <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> in
any Author, be marked out; BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.192

I <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> all such words or things, as either are hard to them in the
learning of them, or which are of some <normalised orig="speciall" auto="true">special</normalised> <normalised orig="excellency" auto="true">excellence</normalised>, or use,
worthy the noting: or which after that they have <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> a <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> time
in construction, they have not either learned, or at least they know
not where they have learned them.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.193

For the marking of them, to do it with little lines under them, or above
them, or against such parts of the word wherein the difficulty <normalised orig="lieth" auto="true">lies</normalised>,
or by some <normalised orig="prickes" auto="true">pricks</normalised>, or whatsoever letter or <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> may best <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> to
call the knowledge of the thing to remembrance, yet so much as may be,
without marring of their books.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.194

To do this, to the end that they may oft-times <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> over these,
or examine and meditate of them more seriously, <normalised orig="untill" auto="true">until</normalised> that they
bee as perfect in them, as in any of the rest of their <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised>:
BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.195

for having these, then have they all.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.196

This would be <normalised orig="universall" auto="true">universal</normalised>, in getting all <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of learning; after
that children do grow to any discretion to <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> such things rightly:
BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.197

you will <normalised orig="marvell" auto="true">marvel</normalised> <paren> if you have not made <normalised orig="triall" auto="true">trial</normalised> of it <$$paren>
how much they will go <normalised orig="thorow" auto="true">thorough</normalised>, and what sound knowledge they will come
unto in any <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> of study; and how <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> by this <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised>, more then they
can do without it.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.198

And when they have once gotten it, they may as easily <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> it, and
as surely, by oft-times running over those things, which are so noted,
above all the rest.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.199

This is the reason that you shall have the <normalised orig="choysest" auto="true">choicest</normalised> <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> of most
great learned men, and the notablest students, all marked <normalised orig="thorow" auto="true">thorough</normalised> thus,
in all matters either obscure, or of <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> and most necessary use.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.200

And this one <normalised orig="chife" auto="true">chef</normalised> <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, whereby <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised> may have the <normalised orig="difficultest" auto="true">difficulties</normalised>
things in their <normalised orig="Authours" auto="true">Authors</normalised> so perfectly, as that <normalised orig="whensoever" auto="true">whenever</normalised> they shall bee
examined of a sudden, they shall be very ready, to their great praise,
and to the just commendation of the <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,46.201

For the manner of noting, it is best to note all School <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> with
<normalised orig="inke" auto="true">ink</normalised>; and also all others, which you would have gotten ad <normalised orig="unguem" auto="true">unseen</normalised>, as
we use <P_47> to say, or whereof we would have daily or long practice;
because <normalised orig="inke" auto="true">ink</normalised> will <normalised orig="indure" auto="true">endure</normalised>: BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.202

neither will such <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> be the worse for their noting, but the better,
if they be noted with judgement.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.203

But for all other <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> which you would have <normalised orig="faire" auto="true">fair</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> at your
pleasure; note them with a <normalised orig="pensil" auto="true">pencil</normalised> of <normalised orig="blacke" auto="true">black</normalised> lead: BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.204

for that you may rub out <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> when you will, with the <normalised orig="crums" auto="true">crumbs</normalised> of new
wheat bread.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.205

The very little ones, which <normalised orig="reade" auto="true">read</normalised> but English, may make some secret <normalised orig="markes" auto="true">marks</normalised>
thus at every hard word; though but with some little dint with their
<normalised orig="naile" auto="true">nail</normalised>: so that they doe not <normalised orig="marre" auto="true">mar</normalised> their <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.206

Of this I shall <normalised orig="speake" auto="true">speak</normalised> more particularly in the manner of parsing,
Chap. 9.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.207

A fourth observation, is this: That whatsoever <normalised orig="bookes" auto="true">books</normalised> or matter <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised>
do <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>, after they <normalised orig="beginne" auto="true">begin</normalised> to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> without <normalised orig="booke" auto="true">book</normalised>; that they <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised>
them so perfectly, and hold them so surely, by daily repetition and
examination, that they may have in their minds such an absolute knowledge
of all the words, and matters which they have learned ; as wheresoever
they shall <normalised orig="meete" auto="true">meet</normalised> with the same <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, or shall have occasion to use
them, they may not <normalised orig="neede" auto="true">need</normalised> to be driven to <normalised orig="learne" auto="true">learn</normalised> $them {HELSINKI:then}
anew; but that they may tell of a sudden where they have learned them,
or can repeat the place: and so make their use and benefit of them.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.208

To teach the same things <normalised orig="twise" auto="true">twice</normalised>, or <normalised orig="thrise" auto="true">thrice</normalised>, is a double labour and <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised>:
BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.209

but to have all things which they have learned, ever in <normalised orig="readinesse" auto="true">readiness</normalised>,
is a singular benefit, and a rare commendation.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.210

For besides the preventing of all <normalised orig="losse" auto="true">loss</normalised> of labour and time, it
shall be to the great delight of all who <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> them tried, and the
exceeding furtherance of their <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> growth in all good learning.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.211

And to effect this yet more fully; acquaint them in all their Lectures
and exercises, some one of them or other, who can tell first, to <normalised orig="repeate" auto="true">repeat</normalised>
where they have learned every hard word: BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.212

and that chiefly in their Grammar, if they have learned it there , to
have that exceeding perfect; and to <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised> surely every new word, according
to the direction which I have before given.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,47.213

<P_48>

A <normalised orig="fift" auto="true">fifth</normalised> <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised> observation, and which is not <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised> to any of the
former, for the good both of Masters and <normalised orig="Schoollers" auto="true">Schoolwork</normalised>, and the very great
benefit of <normalised orig="Schooles" auto="true">Schools</normalised>, is this: that the whole <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised> be divided into
so few <normalised orig="fourmes" auto="true">forms</normalised> as may be, of so many as can any way be fitted to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>
together: though they be <normalised orig="sixteene" auto="true">sixteen</normalised>, or twenty, yes, <normalised orig="fortie" auto="true">forty</normalised> in a <normalised orig="fourme" auto="true">form</normalised>,
BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.215

it is not the worse.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.216

The reasons of it are most <normalised orig="cleere" auto="true">clear</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.217

1.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.218

In most things it is almost the same labour to teach twenty, as to teach
two: as in reading all Lectures and rules unto them, in examining all
parts and Lectures.  Like as it is in Sermons, and <normalised orig="Catechisings" auto="true">Catechising</normalised>, where
it is the same labour to teach one, that it is to teach a thousand,
if all can <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> alike.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.219

This is very <normalised orig="generall" auto="true">general</normalised>, except in exercises of writing; <normalised orig="wherin" auto="true">wherein</normalised> also great
advantage may be gotten by this <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, if right order be observed,
as we shall <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> after.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.220

2.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.221

Secondly, the fewer <normalised orig="fourmes" auto="true">forms</normalised> there are, the more time may be spent in
each <normalised orig="fourme" auto="true">form</normalised>; BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.222

and more labour may be bestowed in examining every tittle necessary.
Which <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of <normalised orig="continuall" auto="true">continual</normalised> examination, is a notable <normalised orig="quickner" auto="true">quagmire</normalised> and <normalised orig="nourisher" auto="true">nursery</normalised>
of all good learning; helping marvellously understanding , audacity,
memory, and provoking emulation of the <normalised orig="Schollers" auto="true">Scholars</normalised>: BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.223

and therefore a <normalised orig="principall" auto="true">principal</normalised> part of the Master's labour, and of the time
in the <normalised orig="Schoole" auto="true">School</normalised>, would be <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised> in this.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.224

3.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.225

By this <normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised>, every one of a <normalised orig="fourme" auto="true">form</normalised> shall some way provoke, or <normalised orig="incourage" auto="true">encourage</normalised>
the rest of their <normalised orig="fellowes" auto="true">fellows</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.226

If they be but dull, the rest will <normalised orig="thinke" auto="true">think</normalised> to go before them;
BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.227

but if they be more pregnant and witty, or more <normalised orig="painefull" auto="true">painful</normalised> and diligent,
they shall put spirits into all the rest, and be as a <normalised orig="spurre" auto="true">spur</normalised> unto them.
BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.228

For there is in our nature an inbred desire to <normalised orig="ayme" auto="true">aim</normalised> at the best, and
to wish to <normalised orig="equalize" auto="true">equalise</normalised> them in each commendable quality: if there be right
<normalised orig="meanes" auto="true">means</normalised> of direction and <normalised orig="incouragement" auto="true">encouragement</normalised> <normalised orig="thereunto" auto="true">torrent</normalised>.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.229

Also every one of a <normalised orig="forme" auto="true">form</normalised> may someway <normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> the rest: BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.230

for none are so dull, but they may <normalised orig="happely" auto="true">happily</normalised> remember some thing, which
none of the rest did.  BRINSLEY-E2-H,48.231
