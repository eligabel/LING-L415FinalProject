Right Trusty and Right <normalised orig="Welbeloved" auto="true">Well-beloved</normalised> Cousin and <normalised orig="Councellour" auto="true">Councellor</normalised>, Wee greet
you well.  CHARLES-1670-E3-H,197,A.22

Whereas Wee have been informed of <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised> disorders fomenting in Our
<normalised orig="Citty" auto="true">City</normalised> of Dublin to create disturbances upon <normalised orig="y=e=" auto="true">yew</normalised> account of <normalised orig="y=e=" auto="true">yew</normalised> late
Rules for regulating that and the other <P_198,A> Corporations of Our
<normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> of Ireland.  And Whereas the procuring of hands to a Petition
against a Law is in it self an Act of Sedition, especially when prepared
to be addressed to such a Power as $can $not {TEXT:cannot} change the
Law, though never <normalised orig="soe" auto="true">so</normalised> <normalised orig="greivous" auto="true">grievous</normalised>.  Wee having taken the same into Our
consideration, and that the said Rules, as <normalised orig="farre" auto="true">far</normalised> as wee can take notice
of them, are <normalised orig="extreamely" auto="true">extremely</normalised> <normalised orig="usefull" auto="true">useful</normalised> to Government in many respects, and
that if Wee should think fit to give way against any complaints, though
they may seem very specious, might yet in the consequence <normalised orig="disturbe" auto="true">disturb</normalised> Our
whole Government there.  And that the said Rules are of <normalised orig="equall" auto="true">equal</normalised> credit
and Authority with the Act of Settlement, the attempt of breaking any
part whereof Wee look upon as very dangerous and <normalised orig="prejudiciall" auto="true">prejudicial</normalised> to Our
Service.  Wee have, therefore, thought fit to direct and require you ,
as Wee doe by these Presents, to use such means as you shall think fit
for the <normalised orig="effectuall" auto="true">effectual</normalised> {COM:sic} suppressing all Preparations to such a
Disorder in the same manner as {in} you would doe any other Sedition,
and that you give Order to Our <normalised orig="Atturney" auto="true">Attorney</normalised> or <normalised orig="Sollicitor" auto="true">Solicitor</normalised> <normalised orig="Generall" auto="true">General</normalised> there to
proceed by information against the <normalised orig="Principall" auto="true">Principal</normalised> movers in this <normalised orig="businesse" auto="true">business</normalised>,
if you should think it for Our Service.  CHARLES-1670-E3-H,198,A.23

<normalised orig="Neverthelesse" auto="true">Nevertheless</normalised>, Our pleasure is, that you enquire and certify unto Us, with
what convenient speed you may, what Numbers there are of persons living
in any of the Corporations of that Our <normalised orig="Kingdome" auto="true">Kingdom</normalised> within the benefit of the
words <bracket> and others <$$bracket> in the second Rule, that may give
occasion of offence, to the End that Wee may be informed whether there may
be any seeming grounds for these complaints.  CHARLES-1670-E3-H,198,A.24

And for <normalised orig="soe" auto="true">so</normalised> doing this shall be your Warrant.  CHARLES-1670-E3-H,198,A.25

And <normalised orig="soe" auto="true">so</normalised> Wee bid you heartily farewell.  CHARLES-1670-E3-H,198,A.26

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the 31=st= day of March, 1674, in the
Six & Twentieth <normalised orig="yeare" auto="true">year</normalised> of Our <normalised orig="Reigne" auto="true">Reign</normalised>.  CHARLES-1670-E3-H,198,A.27
