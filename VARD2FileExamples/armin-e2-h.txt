<P_8>

Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised>, sitting at <normalised orig="cardes" auto="true">cards</normalised> all alone, was dealing to <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> at <normalised orig="vide" auto="true">video</normalised>
<normalised orig="ruffe" auto="true">ruff</normalised> ARMIN-E2-H,8.2

<paren> for that was the game he <normalised orig="ioyed" auto="true">joyed</normalised> in <$$paren> ARMIN-E2-H,8.3

and as he <normalised orig="spide" auto="true">spied</normalised> a <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised> - Ah, <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised>, art there?  quoth he.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.4

When he <normalised orig="spide" auto="true">spied</normalised> a king - King, by your <normalised orig="leaue" auto="true">leave</normalised>, quoth he.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.5

If <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> spied a <normalised orig="queene" auto="true">queen</normalised> - <normalised orig="Queene" auto="true">Queen</normalised> Richard art come?  quoth he; ARMIN-E2-H,8.6

and would <normalised orig="kneele" auto="true">kneel</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>, and bid God <normalised orig="blesse" auto="true">bless</normalised> her <normalised orig="majestie" auto="true">majesty</normalised> <paren> meaning ,
<normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, the then <normalised orig="queene" auto="true">queen</normalised>, whom he heard Sir William <normalised orig="Hollis" auto="true">Holes</normalised>, his <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">moister</normalised>,
so much to pray for <$$paren>.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.7

But <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised> is the jest: ARMIN-E2-H,8.8

Jack, as I say, being at <normalised orig="cardes" auto="true">cards</normalised> all alone, spying a <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised>, and saying ,
Ah, <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised>, art there?  a simple <normalised orig="seruingman" auto="true">serving-man</normalised> being in the hall, <normalised orig="waighting" auto="true">weighting</normalised>
his <normalised orig="maisters" auto="true">masters</normalised> <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised>, walking by, and hearing him say so, thought he
had called him <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,8.9

<normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> the matter in <normalised orig="dudgeen" auto="true">dudgeon</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,8.10

and miscalled the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.11

Another <normalised orig="seruingman" auto="true">serving-man</normalised>, more foolish then both, took Jack's part, so that
in short time they two fell together by the <normalised orig="eares" auto="true">ears</normalised>; who, being parted,
Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> <normalised orig="giues" auto="true">gives</normalised> them each one a hand, ARMIN-E2-H,8.12

and so takes them into the <normalised orig="buttry" auto="true">buttery</normalised> to <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.13

The knight comes in: ARMIN-E2-H,8.14

seeing the hall not yet quiet, <normalised orig="askt" auto="true">asked</normalised> the matter.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.15

Jack comes - ARMIN-E2-H,8.16

$I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} tell thee, Willy, quoth <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.17

As I was a playing at <normalised orig="cardes" auto="true">cards</normalised>, one seeing I <normalised orig="wonne" auto="true">won</normalised> all I <normalised orig="playd" auto="true">played</normalised> for, would
<normalised orig="needes" auto="true">needs</normalised> <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> the <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised> from <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised>, which, as very a <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised> as <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> seeing,
would <normalised orig="needes" auto="true">needs</normalised> <normalised orig="beare" auto="true">bear</normalised> him <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised> for company; ARMIN-E2-H,8.18

so bid them both welcome to thy house - ARMIN-E2-H,8.19

I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> bin to <normalised orig="intreat" auto="true">entreat</normalised> the <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised>, thy butler, to make them <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,8.20

I, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Sir William; ARMIN-E2-H,8.21

and you, like a <normalised orig="knaue" auto="true">knave</normalised>, made them fall out.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.22

I, answered Jack, ARMIN-E2-H,8.23

and your <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>, Sir <normalised orig="Knaue" auto="true">Knave</normalised>, made them friends.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.24

Sir William, laughing, departed.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.25

<normalised orig="Newes" auto="true">News</normalised> came to Sir William that such a nobleman was <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> to his house
: ARMIN-E2-H,8.26

great <normalised orig="prouision" auto="true">provision</normalised> was made for his welcome; ARMIN-E2-H,8.27

and, amongst all, Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> put on his new <normalised orig="motly" auto="true">motley</normalised> <normalised orig="coate" auto="true">coat</normalised>, <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> <normalised orig="muckender" auto="true">mesentery</normalised>,
and his new <normalised orig="shooes" auto="true">shoes</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,8.28

Much preparation was made, which were too long to tell; ARMIN-E2-H,8.29

for, $I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} assure ye, it was one of the greatest <normalised orig="earles" auto="true">earls</normalised> in
England, <normalised orig="vnfit" auto="true">unfit</normalised> to name here: ARMIN-E2-H,8.30

but the <P_9> knight and his <normalised orig="ladie" auto="true">lady</normalised> met him at the gate to <normalised orig="entertaine" auto="true">entertain</normalised> him.
ARMIN-E2-H,9.31

Sir William, with a low <normalised orig="congy" auto="true">conga</normalised>, saluted him; ARMIN-E2-H,9.32

the good lady, as is the courtly custom, was <normalised orig="kist" auto="true">kissed</normalised> of this noble man.
ARMIN-E2-H,9.33

Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised>, seeing him <normalised orig="kisse" auto="true">kiss</normalised> his <normalised orig="ladie" auto="true">lady</normalised>, on the <normalised orig="sodaine" auto="true">sudden</normalised> <normalised orig="giues" auto="true">gives</normalised> the <normalised orig="earle" auto="true">earl</normalised>
a sound box on the <normalised orig="eare" auto="true">ear</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.34

<normalised orig="Knaue" auto="true">Knave</normalised> <paren> quoth he <$$paren> <normalised orig="kisse" auto="true">kiss</normalised> Sir <normalised orig="Willie's" auto="true">Willies</normalised> wife?  ARMIN-E2-H,9.35

The good knight, amazed at this, caused him to be <normalised orig="whipt" auto="true">whipped</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.36

But the <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> noble man, knowing <normalised orig="simplicitie" auto="true">simplicity</normalised> the ground of his <normalised orig="errour" auto="true">error</normalised>,
would not suffer it, ARMIN-E2-H,9.37

but, putting it <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, left him, ARMIN-E2-H,9.38

and <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> the house.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.39

Jack, seeing they were sad, and he had done <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised>, had this wit in
<normalised orig="simplicitie" auto="true">simplicity</normalised> to shadow it: ARMIN-E2-H,9.40

he comes after ARMIN-E2-H,9.41

and <normalised orig="askt" auto="true">asked</normalised> the <normalised orig="earle" auto="true">earl</normalised> <normalised orig="wher" auto="true">where</normalised> his hand was?  ARMIN-E2-H,9.42

Here <paren> quoth he <$$paren> - ARMIN-E2-H,9.43

with that he shakes him by it, ARMIN-E2-H,9.44

and <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised>, I <normalised orig="mistooke" auto="true">mistook</normalised> it before, knowing not your <normalised orig="eare" auto="true">ear</normalised> from your hand,
being so like one another.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.45

Jack thought <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> had mended the matter; ARMIN-E2-H,9.46

but now he was <normalised orig="whipt" auto="true">whipped</normalised> <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,9.47

and had his payment altogether.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.48

Thus <normalised orig="fooles" auto="true">fools</normalised>, thinking to be wise, become flat foolish: ARMIN-E2-H,9.49

but all is one, ARMIN-E2-H,9.50

Jack <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> repented him.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.51

At a Christmas time, when great logs furnish the hall fire - when <normalised orig="brawne" auto="true">brawn</normalised>
is in season, and, <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, all <normalised orig="reveling" auto="true">revelling</normalised> is regarded, this gallant
knight kept open house for all <normalised orig="commers" auto="true">comers</normalised>, where <normalised orig="beefe" auto="true">beef</normalised>, <normalised orig="beere" auto="true">beer</normalised>, and bread
was no niggard.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.52

Amongst all the pleasures <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised>, a <normalised orig="noyse" auto="true">noise</normalised> of <normalised orig="minstrells" auto="true">minstrels</normalised> and a
Lincolnshire bagpipe was prepared - the minstrels for the great chamber,
the bagpipe for the hall - the <normalised orig="minstrells" auto="true">minstrels</normalised> to <normalised orig="serue" auto="true">serve</normalised> <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> the knights <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>,
and the bagpipe for the common <normalised orig="dauncing" auto="true">dancing</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.53

Jack could not endure to bee in the common hall; ARMIN-E2-H,9.54

for, <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> was a little proudly minded, ARMIN-E2-H,9.55

and, therefore, was altogether in the great chamber, at my ladies or
Sir Williams elbow.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.56

One time, being very melancholy, the knight, to rouse him <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised>, <normalised orig="saide" auto="true">said</normalised>,
Hence, <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>!  ARMIN-E2-H,9.57

$I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> another <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,9.58

thou shalt dwell no longer with me.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.59

Jack to this answered little; though, <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, ye could not anger
him worse.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.60

A gentleman at the <normalised orig="boord" auto="true">board</normalised> answers, If it please you, sir, $I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised>
{TEXT:Ile} bring ye another <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.61

I pray ye do <paren> quoth the knight <$$paren> ARMIN-E2-H,9.62

and he shall be welcome.  ARMIN-E2-H,9.63

Jack fell a crying, ARMIN-E2-H,9.64

and departed mad and angry down into the <P_10> great hall;
ARMIN-E2-H,10.65

and, being strong armed <paren> as before I described him <$$paren>,
caught the bagpipes from the piper, ARMIN-E2-H,10.66

<normalised orig="knockt" auto="true">knocked</normalised> them about his pate, that he laid the fellow for dead on the
ground, ARMIN-E2-H,10.67

and, all broken, carries the pipes <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> into the great chamber,
ARMIN-E2-H,10.68

and <normalised orig="layes" auto="true">lays</normalised> them on the fire.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.69

The knight, knowing by Jack that something was <normalised orig="amisse" auto="true">amiss</normalised>, <normalised orig="sendes" auto="true">sends</normalised> <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>
to see.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.70

<normalised orig="Newes" auto="true">News</normalised> of this jest came; ARMIN-E2-H,10.71

the knight, angry <paren> but to no purpose, for he <normalised orig="loued" auto="true">loved</normalised> the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>
<normalised orig="aboue" auto="true">above</normalised> all, and that the household knew, else Jack had paid for it,
for the common peoples <normalised orig="dauncing" auto="true">dancing</normalised> was spoiled <$$paren> sent <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> Jack,
ARMIN-E2-H,10.72

and bad him out of his sight.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.73

Jack cries, Hang Sir Willy, hang Sir Willy, ARMIN-E2-H,10.74

and <normalised orig="departes" auto="true">departs</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.75

Sir William, not knowing how to amend the matter, caused the piper to
be carried to bed, who was very ill, ARMIN-E2-H,10.76

and said, I would now <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> a gold noble for a <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>: <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, to anger
him <normalised orig="throughly" auto="true">thoroughly</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,10.77

one of the minstrels whispers a gentleman in the <normalised orig="eare" auto="true">ear</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,10.78

and said, If it pleased him, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> would; whereat the gentleman <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,10.79

The knight <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> the reason of his laughing.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.80

I pray you tell me <paren> quoth <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <$$paren> - ARMIN-E2-H,10.81

for laughing could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> come in a better time - ARMIN-E2-H,10.82

the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> hath <normalised orig="madded" auto="true">matted</normalised> me.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.83

If it please you <paren> <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the gentleman <$$paren>, here is a good
fellow will <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> and attire him in one of his <normalised orig="coates" auto="true">coats</normalised>, and can in all
<normalised orig="poynts" auto="true">points</normalised> <normalised orig="behaue" auto="true">behave</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> naturally, like such a one.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.84

It is good <paren> <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the knight <$$paren> ARMIN-E2-H,10.85

and I $pray $thee {TEXT:prethee}, good fellow, about it; ARMIN-E2-H,10.86

and one <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> call Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> <normalised orig="hether" auto="true">hither</normalised>, that wee may hold him with talk in
the <normalised orig="meane" auto="true">mean</normalised> time.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.87

The simple <normalised orig="minstrell" auto="true">minstrel</normalised>, thinking to <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> wonders, as one <normalised orig="ouerjoyed" auto="true">overjoyed</normalised> at
the good <normalised orig="opportunitie" auto="true">opportunity</normalised>, threw his fiddle one way, his stick another,
and his case the third way, ARMIN-E2-H,10.88

and was in such a case of joy, that it was no boot to bid him make <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised>
: ARMIN-E2-H,10.89

but, proud of the knight <normalised orig="fauor" auto="true">favour</normalised>, away he flings, as if he went to <normalised orig="tak" auto="true">take</normalised>
possession of some great lordship; ARMIN-E2-H,10.90

but, what ere he got by it, I am sure his fiddle, with the fall, fell
in pieces, which <normalised orig="grieued" auto="true">grieved</normalised> his <normalised orig="maister" auto="true">moister</normalised> so, that, in <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> and <normalised orig="pittie" auto="true">pity</normalised>,
he laughed till the water ran <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> his <normalised orig="cheekes" auto="true">cheeks</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,10.91

Beside, this good knight was like to <P_11> <normalised orig="keepe" auto="true">keep</normalised> a bad Christmas,
ARMIN-E2-H,11.92

for the bagpipes and the <normalised orig="musicke" auto="true">music</normalised> went to <normalised orig="wracke" auto="true">wrack</normalised> - ARMIN-E2-H,11.93

the one burnt, ARMIN-E2-H,11.94

and the other broken.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.95

In comes Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,11.96

and <paren> being merry <$$paren> told the knight and the rest that a
country-wench in the hall had eaten <normalised orig="garlicke" auto="true">garlic</normalised>, and there was <normalised orig="seuenteene" auto="true">seventeen</normalised>
men <normalised orig="poysoned" auto="true">poisoned</normalised> with kissing her: ARMIN-E2-H,11.97

for it was his <normalised orig="vse" auto="true">use</normalised> to jest thus.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.98

By and by comes in a messenger <paren> one of the knights men <$$paren>
to tell him that such a gentleman had sent his <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> to dwell with him.
ARMIN-E2-H,11.99

<normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">Hoe</normalised> is welcome, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the knight, ARMIN-E2-H,11.100

for I am weary of this <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,11.101

<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> bid him come in - ARMIN-E2-H,11.102

Jack, bid him welcome.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.103

They all <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised> to see Jack's colour come and <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, like a wise man ready
to make a good end.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.104

What say you to this?  <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the knight.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.105

Not one word <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Jack.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.106

They tinged with a knife at the <normalised orig="bottome" auto="true">bottom</normalised> of a <normalised orig="glasse" auto="true">glass</normalised>, as <normalised orig="toulling" auto="true">tolling</normalised> the
bell for the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, who was <normalised orig="speechlesse" auto="true">speechless</normalised> and would dye <paren> then which
nothing could more anger him <$$paren>; ARMIN-E2-H,11.107

but now the thought of the new come <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> so much <normalised orig="moued" auto="true">moved</normalised> him, that he
was as dead as a <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> <normalised orig="nayle" auto="true">nail</normalised> - standing on tip-toe, looking toward
the door to behold <normalised orig="ariuall" auto="true">arrival</normalised>, that he would put his nose out of joint.
ARMIN-E2-H,11.108

By and by enters my <normalised orig="artificiall" auto="true">artificial</normalised> <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> in his old <normalised orig="cloaths" auto="true">clothes</normalised>, making wry
<normalised orig="mouthes" auto="true">mouths</normalised>, <normalised orig="dauncing" auto="true">dancing</normalised>, and looking a squint: who, when Jack beheld, <normalised orig="sodainely" auto="true">suddenly</normalised>
he flew at him, and so violently <normalised orig="beate" auto="true">beat</normalised> him, that all the table rose,
but could scarce get him off.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.109

Well, off he was at length: ARMIN-E2-H,11.110

the knight caused the broken ones to be by <normalised orig="themselues" auto="true">themselves</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.111

My <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> <normalised orig="minstrell" auto="true">minstrel</normalised>, with a fall, had his head broke to the skull against
the ground, his face <normalised orig="scratcht" auto="true">scratched</normalised>; that which was worst of all his left eye
put out, ARMIN-E2-H,11.112

and <normalised orig="withall" auto="true">withal</normalised> so sore bruised, that he could <normalised orig="neyther" auto="true">neither</normalised> stand nor <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,11.113

The knight caused him to bee <normalised orig="laide" auto="true">laid</normalised> with the <normalised orig="pyper" auto="true">piper</normalised>, who was also hurt in
the like conflict, who <normalised orig="lackt" auto="true">lacked</normalised> no good looking to, because they miscarried
in the knights <normalised orig="seruice" auto="true">service</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,11.114

but <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> after Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> could not endure to <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> any <normalised orig="talke" auto="true">talk</normalised> of another
<normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> to be there, ARMIN-E2-H,11.115

and the knight <normalised orig="durst" auto="true">dared</normalised> not make such a motion.  ARMIN-E2-H,11.116

The <normalised orig="pyper" auto="true">piper</normalised> and the minstrel, being in bed together, one <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised>, O!
his <normalised orig="backe" auto="true">back</normalised> and face; the other, O!  his face and eye: ARMIN-E2-H,11.117

the one <normalised orig="cryed" auto="true">cried</normalised> O his <normalised orig="pype" auto="true">pipe</normalised>!  the other, O his fiddle!  ARMIN-E2-H,11.118

Good <P_12> <normalised orig="mussicke" auto="true">music</normalised> or broken consorts, they agree well together;
ARMIN-E2-H,12.119

but when they were well, they were contented for their <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised>:
ARMIN-E2-H,12.120

they had both money and the knights <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,12.121

Here you <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> heard the difference <normalised orig="twixt" auto="true">twist</normalised> a flat <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> <normalised orig="naturall" auto="true">natural</normalised>, and a
flat <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> <normalised orig="artificiall" auto="true">artificial</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,12.122

one that did his <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised>, and the other who foolishly followed his
<normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="minde" auto="true">mind</normalised>: on which two is written this Rime: {COM:verse_omitted}
ARMIN-E2-H,12.123

Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> abide the cooke, by reason that he would scald
him out of the kitchen.  ARMIN-E2-H,12.124

Upon a time he had a great charge from his Lady to make her a quince
pie of purpose for Sir Williams <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> eating, which the cooke <normalised orig="endeuored" auto="true">endeavoured</normalised>
to doe, ARMIN-E2-H,12.125

and sent to <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised> of purpose to the apothecaries for <normalised orig="choyse" auto="true">choice</normalised> quinces.
ARMIN-E2-H,12.126

Jack, being at this charge <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised>, thought to be <normalised orig="euen" auto="true">even</normalised> with the cooke,
ARMIN-E2-H,12.127

and waited the time when this Pie was made.  ARMIN-E2-H,12.128

It <normalised orig="hapned" auto="true">happened</normalised> so, the cooke could get no quinces: ARMIN-E2-H,12.129

my lady <paren> for it was the knight's desire to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> one <$$paren>
sent about to Boston, and all the <normalised orig="chiefe" auto="true">chief</normalised> <normalised orig="townes" auto="true">towns</normalised>, but all in <normalised orig="vaine" auto="true">vain</normalised> -
ARMIN-E2-H,12.130

the season <normalised orig="serued" auto="true">served</normalised> not; ARMIN-E2-H,12.131

but, rather then Sir William should be <normalised orig="vnfurnished" auto="true">unfurnished</normalised>, sent to <normalised orig="Lincolne" auto="true">Lincoln</normalised>
<normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised> to buy <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> many quinces, ready preserved at <normalised orig="pothecaries" auto="true">apothecaries</normalised>, which
she had, though with great cost.  ARMIN-E2-H,12.132

The knight, asking his Lady for his pie, she told him with much <normalised orig="adoe" auto="true">ado</normalised>
she had <normalised orig="preuailed" auto="true">prevailed</normalised>, but with no little <normalised orig="paines" auto="true">pains</normalised>, in seeking quinces;
ARMIN-E2-H,12.133

for she <P_13> was <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised> to buy them ready <normalised orig="preserued" auto="true">preserved</normalised>, and to make a
<normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> of necessity that way.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.134

Sir William, seeing it was so, said it should bee as well eaten,
ARMIN-E2-H,13.135

and sent for his friends, gentlemen and others of no small account.
ARMIN-E2-H,13.136

There was other great <normalised orig="cheare" auto="true">cheer</normalised> <normalised orig="prouided" auto="true">provided</normalised> to furnish <normalised orig="vp" auto="true">up</normalised> this sumptuous feast
, ARMIN-E2-H,13.137

and as he <normalised orig="inuited" auto="true">invited</normalised> them, <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="tolde" auto="true">told</normalised> them it was a quince pie, which he
would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> eaten.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.138

The day drew on, ARMIN-E2-H,13.139

and the gentiles were come, ARMIN-E2-H,13.140

and all was in a <normalised orig="redinesse" auto="true">readiness</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,13.141

and still Jack <normalised orig="forgat" auto="true">forgot</normalised> not the pie, ARMIN-E2-H,13.142

but stood faintly <normalised orig="sicke" auto="true">sick</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,13.143

and refused his <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,13.144

the knight, <normalised orig="sory" auto="true">sorry</normalised> that his best dish <normalised orig="fayled" auto="true">failed</normalised> him, made no small account
of his well fare, ARMIN-E2-H,13.145

<normalised orig="askte" auto="true">asked</normalised> him, Jack, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, where <normalised orig="lyes" auto="true">lies</normalised> thy <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,13.146

In my mouth, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <paren> meaning, <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, his mouth hung for the
quince pie.  <$$paren> ARMIN-E2-H,13.147

A barber was sent for from the market <normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> hard by, who <normalised orig="searcht" auto="true">searched</normalised> his
mouth, and could <normalised orig="finde" auto="true">find</normalised> no cause of <normalised orig="paine" auto="true">pain</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,13.148

but Sir William, thinking the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> wanted wit to tell his <normalised orig="griefe" auto="true">grief</normalised> <paren>
though not wit to play the <normalised orig="thiefe" auto="true">thief</normalised> <$$paren> had the barber depart,
asking <normalised orig="Jacke" auto="true">Jack</normalised> what he would <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,13.149

he <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, nothing.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.150

What he would <normalised orig="drinke" auto="true">drink</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,13.151

he <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, nothing; which made Sir William doubt much of his health,
refusing his <normalised orig="liquour" auto="true">liquor</normalised> when it was usually his practice, and the knight
joyed in it too: ARMIN-E2-H,13.152

<normalised orig="askit" auto="true">asked</normalised> him if he would lie <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,13.153

still answering no, ARMIN-E2-H,13.154

but would stand by the kitchen fire.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.155

The knight, that never came there but he did some <normalised orig="exployte" auto="true">exploit</normalised>, forgetting
that, led him by the hand <paren> so much he made of him <$$paren>
ARMIN-E2-H,13.156

and bad the cooke see he wanted nothing.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.157

Jack, standing still, <normalised orig="groan'd" auto="true">groaned</normalised> ARMIN-E2-H,13.158

and <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised>, If he dyed, he would forgive all the world but the cooke.
ARMIN-E2-H,13.159

Hang, <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, <paren> <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the cooke <$$paren> ARMIN-E2-H,13.160

I care not for thee: ARMIN-E2-H,13.161

die to-morrow if thou wilt, ARMIN-E2-H,13.162

and so followed his business.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.163

They <normalised orig="knockt" auto="true">knocked</normalised> to the dresser, ARMIN-E2-H,13.164

and the dinner went up.  ARMIN-E2-H,13.165

Jack had a <normalised orig="sheepes" auto="true">sheep</normalised> eye in the oven: ARMIN-E2-H,13.166

<normalised orig="anone" auto="true">anon</normalised> the second course came, ARMIN-E2-H,13.167

the pie was <normalised orig="drawne" auto="true">drawn</normalised>, set by, ARMIN-E2-H,13.168

and among other <normalised orig="backt" auto="true">backed</normalised> <normalised orig="meates" auto="true">meats</normalised> was to be sent up; ARMIN-E2-H,13.169

but, wanting sugar, <normalised orig="stept" auto="true">stepped</normalised> aside to the <normalised orig="spicerie" auto="true">spicery</normalised> to fetch it;
ARMIN-E2-H,13.170

and Jack, in the meantime, <normalised orig="catcheth" auto="true">catches</normalised> the pie ARMIN-E2-H,13.171

and claps it under his <normalised orig="coate" auto="true">coat</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,13.172

and so runs through the hall into the yard, where was a <normalised orig="broade" auto="true">broad</normalised> <normalised orig="moate" auto="true">moat</normalised>:
ARMIN-E2-H,13.173

and, as he ran, the <P_14> hot pie burned his belly.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.174

I, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Jack, are ye so hot, Sir Willies pie?  ARMIN-E2-H,14.175

$I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} <normalised orig="quence" auto="true">quince</normalised> ye <normalised orig="anone" auto="true">anon</normalised> Sir Willies pie, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> he;
ARMIN-E2-H,14.176

and straight, very <normalised orig="subtilly" auto="true">subtly</normalised>, <normalised orig="leapes" auto="true">leaps</normalised> into the <normalised orig="moate" auto="true">moat</normalised> up to the arm-pits ,
ARMIN-E2-H,14.177

and there stood eating the pie.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.178

The cooke comes in, ARMIN-E2-H,14.179

misses the pie, ARMIN-E2-H,14.180

withal misses Jack, ARMIN-E2-H,14.181

<normalised orig="cryes" auto="true">cries</normalised> out, The pie!  ARMIN-E2-H,14.182

Sir Williams pie was gone, ARMIN-E2-H,14.183

the author of that feast was gone, ARMIN-E2-H,14.184

and they all were undone.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.185

A <normalised orig="hurly" auto="true">hourly</normalised> burly went through the house, ARMIN-E2-H,14.186

and one comes ARMIN-E2-H,14.187

and whispers the lady with the <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,14.188

she <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> Sir William how Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> had stolen the pie.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.189

Jack was <normalised orig="searcht" auto="true">searched</normalised> for, and anon found in the <normalised orig="moate" auto="true">moat</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.190

It was told the knight where the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> was eating it.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.191

Gentlemen <paren> quoth he <$$paren> we are <normalised orig="disfurnished" auto="true">disfranchised</normalised> of our feast;
ARMIN-E2-H,14.192

for Jack, my <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, is in my <normalised orig="moate" auto="true">moat</normalised>, up to the <normalised orig="arme-pits" auto="true">armpits</normalised>, eating of
the pie.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.193

They <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,14.194

and ran to the windows to see the jest: ARMIN-E2-H,14.195

then they might see Jack <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>, the cooke call, the people hallow, but
to no purpose.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.196

Jack fed, ARMIN-E2-H,14.197

and, feeding greedily, <paren> more to anger the cooke, than <normalised orig="disapoint" auto="true">disappoint</normalised>
Sir William <$$paren> ever as he burnt his mouth with <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised>, <normalised orig="dipt" auto="true">dipped</normalised> the
pie in the water to <normalised orig="coole" auto="true">cool</normalised> it.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.198

O!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the cooke, ARMIN-E2-H,14.199

it is Sir <normalised orig="William's" auto="true">Williams</normalised> <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> pie, <normalised orig="sirra" auto="true">sir</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.200

O!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Jack hang thee and Sir Willy too: ARMIN-E2-H,14.201

I care not; ARMIN-E2-H,14.202

it is mine now.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.203

Save Sir William some, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> one; ARMIN-E2-H,14.204

save my lady some, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> another.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.205

By James, not a bit, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Jack; ARMIN-E2-H,14.206

and <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> up all, to the wonder of the beholders, who never knew him <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised>
so much before, but drink ten times more.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.207

At length out comes Jack dropping dry, ARMIN-E2-H,14.208

and goes to get fire to dry him: ARMIN-E2-H,14.209

the knight and the rest all <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised> a good {COM:sic} at the jest: not
knowing how to amend it, ARMIN-E2-H,14.210

Sir William sends for the cooke, who came up with a sorrowful heart,
ARMIN-E2-H,14.211

and, lamentably complaining, said it was the knights fault for placing
him in the kitchen, where he never was but <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> did like <normalised orig="villany" auto="true">villainy</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,14.212

The knight, not satisfied with the <normalised orig="cookes" auto="true">cooks</normalised> <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>, presently discharges
him of his service, ARMIN-E2-H,14.213

and sent him to live elsewhere.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.214

<normalised orig="Goe" auto="true">Go</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,14.215

<normalised orig="trusse" auto="true">truss</normalised> up your trinkets ARMIN-E2-H,14.216

and be gone.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.217

The cooke, seeing no remedy, departed.  ARMIN-E2-H,14.218

Jack, being dry, up he comes; ARMIN-E2-H,14.219

and, knowing he had offended, <P_15> <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> a jest <paren> for it was his
manner so to doe <$$paren> how a young man brake his <normalised orig="codpiece" auto="true">codifies</normalised> point, and
let all be <normalised orig="seene" auto="true">seen</normalised> that God sent him, or such fooleries, ARMIN-E2-H,15.220

but that was not enough; ARMIN-E2-H,15.221

and to chide him was to make of things worse <normalised orig="then't" auto="true">don't</normalised> was, and to no
purpose neither.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.222

Sir William <normalised orig="demaunded" auto="true">demanded</normalised> why <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> the <normalised orig="pye" auto="true">pie</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,15.223

Because I had a <normalised orig="stomacke" auto="true">stomach</normalised>, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Jack.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.224

Would nought else serve, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the knight, but my <normalised orig="pye" auto="true">pie</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,15.225

No, Willy, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> he, thou would not be angry then, ARMIN-E2-H,15.226

and the cooke had not been turned away: ARMIN-E2-H,15.227

but all is well - ARMIN-E2-H,15.228

thou art rich enough to buy more.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.229

The knight, perceiving the <normalised orig="fooles" auto="true">fools</normalised> <normalised orig="envie" auto="true">envy</normalised>, sent for the cooke,
ARMIN-E2-H,15.230

and bid him enjoy his place <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.231

So all parties $were well pleased but the <normalised orig="yong" auto="true">young</normalised> big-bellied woman, who,
perchance, longed for this long looked for pie; ARMIN-E2-H,15.232

but if she did, though long <normalised orig="lookt" auto="true">looked</normalised> for comes at last, yet they <normalised orig="shoote" auto="true">shoot</normalised>
short that <normalised orig="ayme" auto="true">aim</normalised> to hit this <normalised orig="marke" auto="true">mark</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,15.233

for Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised> had eaten the pie ARMIN-E2-H,15.234

and served <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.235

This was a flat <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,15.236

yet, now and then, a blind man may hit a crow, ARMIN-E2-H,15.237

and you know a <normalised orig="fooles" auto="true">fools</normalised> <normalised orig="boult" auto="true">bolt</normalised> is <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> shot: ARMIN-E2-H,15.238

out it goes, happen how it will.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.239

Had Jack kept his <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> <normalised orig="counsell" auto="true">counsel</normalised>, the cooke had <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> still out of service,
ARMIN-E2-H,15.240

and $he had been revenged, ARMIN-E2-H,15.241

but now, being in his place <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, may live to cry <normalised orig="quittance" auto="true">quitting</normalised> for the
quince <normalised orig="pye" auto="true">pie</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,15.242

<P_42>

Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>, in no little credit in the king's court, walking in the
<normalised orig="parke" auto="true">park</normalised> at Greenwich, fell <normalised orig="asleepe" auto="true">asleep</normalised> on the stile that leads into the walk ,
ARMIN-E2-H,42.244

and many that would <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> gone that way so much <normalised orig="loued" auto="true">loved</normalised> him, that they were
<normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to disease him, ARMIN-E2-H,42.245

but went another way; ARMIN-E2-H,42.246

I, the better sort, ARMIN-E2-H,42.247

for now <normalised orig="adaies" auto="true">adays</normalised> beggars are gallants, while gentiles of right blood <normalised orig="seeme" auto="true">seem</normalised>
tame ruffians; ARMIN-E2-H,42.248

but note the <normalised orig="loue" auto="true">love</normalised> Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> got.  ARMIN-E2-H,42.249

A <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> woman, seeing him <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised> so dangerously, <normalised orig="eyther" auto="true">either</normalised> to <normalised orig="fal" auto="true">fall</normalised> backward ,
or to hurt his head leaning so against a post, <normalised orig="fetcht" auto="true">fetched</normalised> him a cushion and
a rope; the one for his head, and the other to bind him to the post,
from falling backward: ARMIN-E2-H,42.250

and thus <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> slept, ARMIN-E2-H,42.251

and the woman stood by, attending as the groom of his chamber.
ARMIN-E2-H,42.252

It changed so, that upon great occasion, as you shall after <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised>,
Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> uncle came out of Shropshire to <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> him in the court;
a <normalised orig="plaine" auto="true">plain</normalised> old man of threescore <normalised orig="yeeres" auto="true">years</normalised>, with a buttoned cap, a <normalised orig="lockram" auto="true">lukewarm</normalised>
falling band, course but <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised>, a russet coat, a white belt of a horse
hide, right <normalised orig="horse-coller" auto="true">horse-collar</normalised> white leather, a close, round breech of russet
<normalised orig="sheeps" auto="true">cheeps</normalised> wool, with a long stock of white <normalised orig="kersey" auto="true">kirk's</normalised>, a high shoe with <normalised orig="yelow" auto="true">yellow</normalised>
buckles, all white with dust; ARMIN-E2-H,42.253

for that day the good old man had come three and twenty miles on foot.
ARMIN-E2-H,42.254

This <normalised orig="kinde" auto="true">kind</normalised> old man, <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> up in his <normalised orig="countrys" auto="true">countries</normalised> <normalised orig="behalfe" auto="true">behalf</normalised>, and <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> into
<normalised orig="Greenwitch" auto="true">Greenwich</normalised>, asked the way to the court: ARMIN-E2-H,42.255

<normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> one directs him; ARMIN-E2-H,42.256

but one <normalised orig="villaine" auto="true">villain</normalised> page directs him by the court gate, to <normalised orig="crosse" auto="true">cross</normalised> in a boat
over to <normalised orig="Blackwal" auto="true">Bleakly</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,42.257

and told him that was the court.  ARMIN-E2-H,42.258

The silly old man willingly paid his penny before hand, ARMIN-E2-H,42.259

and was going <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,42.260

but some that <normalised orig="ouer-heard" auto="true">airworthy</normalised> their talk, hindered his journey
ARMIN-E2-H,42.261

and laughed <P_43> at the jest, ARMIN-E2-H,43.262

yet pitied his <normalised orig="simplicitie" auto="true">simplicity</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,43.263

and sets him in the right way.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.264

When he came in and saw such a place, he was amazed, ARMIN-E2-H,43.265

and stood gazing, which the <normalised orig="gard" auto="true">guard</normalised> and gentlewomen, in their windows,
had much sport to see.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.266

At last one asked him what he was?  ARMIN-E2-H,43.267

The old man <normalised orig="answeres" auto="true">answers</normalised>, A <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> Shropshire man; ARMIN-E2-H,43.268

and demands if there were not a gentleman in the court dwelling, called
by the name of M. Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,43.269

for the country hearing him in <normalised orig="fauour" auto="true">favour</normalised> in the court, said <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> was so
at least.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.270

The courtier answered, Here is such a one <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.271

For fault of a worse, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, I am his uncle; ARMIN-E2-H,43.272

and wept with joy that <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> should see him.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.273

Marry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the man, $I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} help you to him straight;
ARMIN-E2-H,43.274

for, I tell you, not any in the court <normalised orig="durst" auto="true">dared</normalised> but <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> sought him, which
this man did, ARMIN-E2-H,43.275

and it was told him.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.276

<normalised orig="Hee" auto="true">Hoe</normalised> was <normalised orig="walkt" auto="true">walked</normalised> into the <normalised orig="parke" auto="true">park</normalised>, while the king slept that <normalised orig="hote" auto="true">hot</normalised> day.
ARMIN-E2-H,43.277

<normalised orig="Thether" auto="true">Thither</normalised> went they to <normalised orig="seeke" auto="true">seek</normalised> him.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.278

All this while my friend Will was in counsel with the post;
ARMIN-E2-H,43.279

and the cushion stood as arbitrator <normalised orig="betwixte" auto="true">betwixt</normalised> them, and the woman as a
<normalised orig="witnesse" auto="true">witness</normalised> what was said and done.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.280

At last came these two ARMIN-E2-H,43.281

and wakened him.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.282

William, seeing his head soft, What soft post $is {TEXT:in} this?
quoth he.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.283

A post of mine own making, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the woman.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.284

But she lost nothing by her good will; ARMIN-E2-H,43.285

for ere <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> left Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>, <normalised orig="shee" auto="true">she</normalised> got him to get her sons pardon of the
king, who was to bee hanged three days after for piracy: ARMIN-E2-H,43.286

but by Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> means he deceived the hang-man.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.287

This and many good <normalised orig="deedes" auto="true">deeds</normalised> he did to <normalised orig="diuers" auto="true">divers</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.288

The <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, being wakened, <normalised orig="lookes" auto="true">looks</normalised> about him; ARMIN-E2-H,43.289

when he had thanked the woman, asked what <normalised orig="newes" auto="true">news</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,43.290

<normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the man, Sir, here is your uncle come out of the country to see you.
ARMIN-E2-H,43.291

God a mercy cousin!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,43.292

I thank thee for thy labour, ARMIN-E2-H,43.293

you $can $not {TEXT:cannot} uncle me so.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.294

Yes, truly, sir, I am your own <normalised orig="deare" auto="true">dear</normalised> uncle, M. William,
ARMIN-E2-H,43.295

and with that wept.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.296

Are you my uncle?  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.297

I, sir, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.298

Are you my uncle?  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.299

I, sure, and <normalised orig="verely" auto="true">verily</normalised> too.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.300

But are you my uncle, indeed?  ARMIN-E2-H,43.301

By my <normalised orig="vusse" auto="true">vase</normalised> I am, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the old man.  ARMIN-E2-H,43.302

Then, uncle, by my <normalised orig="vusse" auto="true">vase</normalised>, welcome to court, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,43.303

But what make you <normalised orig="heere" auto="true">here</normalised>, uncle?  ARMIN-E2-H,43.304

He ups and <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> his <normalised orig="comming" auto="true">coming</normalised> <P_44> to him.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.305

Will takes him by the hand: ARMIN-E2-H,44.306

Come, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,44.307

thou shalt see Harry, <normalised orig="onckle" auto="true">uncle</normalised> - the <normalised orig="onely" auto="true">only</normalised> Harry in England;
ARMIN-E2-H,44.308

so he led him to the chamber of presence, ARMIN-E2-H,44.309

and <normalised orig="euer" auto="true">ever</normalised> and anon <normalised orig="cryes" auto="true">cries</normalised> out, Aware, <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised> for me and my uncle!
ARMIN-E2-H,44.310

and <normalised orig="knaues" auto="true">knaves</normalised> bid him welcome.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.311

You are welcome, sir, said they: ARMIN-E2-H,44.312

the old man thought <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised> no earthly man, they honoured him so much.
ARMIN-E2-H,44.313

But Will, ready to enter the presence, <normalised orig="lookes" auto="true">looks</normalised> on his uncle,
ARMIN-E2-H,44.314

and seeing him not fine enough to <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> on the king: Come, uncle, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised>
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,44.315

we will <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> your <normalised orig="geere" auto="true">gear</normalised> mended; ARMIN-E2-H,44.316

leads him to his chamber, ARMIN-E2-H,44.317

and attires him in his best <normalised orig="fooles" auto="true">fools</normalised> <normalised orig="coate" auto="true">coat</normalised>, simply, God wot, meaning well
to him; ARMIN-E2-H,44.318

and the simple old man as simply put it on, cap and all.
ARMIN-E2-H,44.319

But they come; ARMIN-E2-H,44.320

and up they came, ARMIN-E2-H,44.321

and to the king they <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>, who, being with the lord treasurer alone,
merry, seeing them two, how Will had got another <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, knew there was
sport at hand.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.322

How now!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king, What news with you?  ARMIN-E2-H,44.323

O, Harry!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> he, this is my <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised> uncle; ARMIN-E2-H,44.324

bid him welcome.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.325

<normalised orig="Wel" auto="true">Well</normalised>, said the king, he is welcome.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.326

Harry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, <normalised orig="heare" auto="true">hear</normalised> me tell thee a tale, and I will make thee rich,
ARMIN-E2-H,44.327

and my uncle shall be made rich by thee.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.328

Will <normalised orig="tels" auto="true">tells</normalised> the king how <normalised orig="Terrils" auto="true">Trails</normalised> <normalised orig="Frith" auto="true">Fred</normalised> was <normalised orig="inclosed" auto="true">enclosed</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.329

<normalised orig="Tirrels" auto="true">Tireless</normalised> <normalised orig="Frith" auto="true">Fred</normalised>!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king; ARMIN-E2-H,44.330

what is that?  ARMIN-E2-H,44.331

Why, the heath where I was borne, called by the name of <normalised orig="Tirrels" auto="true">Tireless</normalised> <normalised orig="Frith" auto="true">Fred</normalised> :
ARMIN-E2-H,44.332

now a gentleman of that name takes it all in, ARMIN-E2-H,44.333

and makes people <normalised orig="beleeue" auto="true">believe</normalised> it is all his, ARMIN-E2-H,44.334

for it took the name from him; so that, Harry, the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> pine, and their
cattle are all undone without thy help.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.335

And what should I doe?  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.336

Marry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will, send to the Bishop of Hereford; ARMIN-E2-H,44.337

<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> is a great man with <normalised orig="Terril" auto="true">Trail</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,44.338

<normalised orig="commaund" auto="true">command</normalised> him to set the <normalised orig="Frith" auto="true">Fred</normalised> at liberty <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, who is now imprisoned
by his means.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.339

And how shall I be rich by that?  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.340

The <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> will pray for thee, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will; ARMIN-E2-H,44.341

and thou shalt bee rich in <normalised orig="heauen" auto="true">heaven</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,44.342

for on earth thou art rich already.  ARMIN-E2-H,44.343

All this was done, ARMIN-E2-H,44.344

and Wills uncle went home, who, while he <normalised orig="liued" auto="true">lived</normalised>, for that deed was
allowed <normalised orig="bayly" auto="true">bailey</normalised> of the common, which place was worth twenty pound a <normalised orig="yeere" auto="true">year</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,44.345

<P_45>

<normalised orig="Howseuer" auto="true">Howsoever</normalised>, these three things it came in memory, and are for mirth <normalised orig="incerted" auto="true">inserted</normalised>
into stage <normalised orig="playes" auto="true">plays</normalised> I know not, ARMIN-E2-H,45.347

but that Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> asked them of the king, it is <normalised orig="certaine" auto="true">certain</normalised>:
ARMIN-E2-H,45.348

there are some will <normalised orig="affirme" auto="true">affirm</normalised> it now living at Greenwich.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.349

The king being on a time <normalised orig="extreame" auto="true">extreme</normalised> melancholy, and full of passion,
all that Will could doe will not make him merry.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.350

Ah!  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,45.351

this must <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised>, must <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> a good <normalised orig="showre" auto="true">shower</normalised> to <normalised orig="clense" auto="true">cleanse</normalised> it; ARMIN-E2-H,45.352

and with that goes <normalised orig="behinde" auto="true">behind</normalised> the <normalised orig="arras" auto="true">ares</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.353

Harry, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, $I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} $<normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> {TEXT:foe} behind the <normalised orig="arras" auto="true">ares</normalised>,
and study three questions, and come <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,45.354

see, therefore, you lay aside this melancloly muse, and study to
<normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> me.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.355

I, quoth the king: ARMIN-E2-H,45.356

they will be wise ones, no doubt.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.357

At last out comes William with his wit, as the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> of the play does,
with an <normalised orig="anticke" auto="true">antique</normalised> <normalised orig="looke" auto="true">look</normalised> to please the beholders.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.358

Harry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, what is it, that the lesser it is, the more it is to
be feared?  ARMIN-E2-H,45.359

The king mused at it; ARMIN-E2-H,45.360

but, to grace the jest better, he answered, he knew not.
ARMIN-E2-H,45.361

Will answered, it was a little bridge <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> a <normalised orig="deepe" auto="true">deep</normalised> <normalised orig="riuer" auto="true">river</normalised>; at which
<normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="smyled" auto="true">smiled</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.362

What is the next, William?  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.363

Marry, this is the next: ARMIN-E2-H,45.364

what is the cleanliest trade in the world?  ARMIN-E2-H,45.365

Marry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king, I think a <normalised orig="comfit-maker" auto="true">competencies</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,45.366

for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="deales" auto="true">deals</normalised> with nothing but pure ware, ARMIN-E2-H,45.367

and is attired <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> in white linen when <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="sels" auto="true">sells</normalised> it.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.368

No, Harry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <em> he to <$$em> the king; ARMIN-E2-H,45.369

you are wide.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.370

What say you, then?  quoth the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.371

Marry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will, I say a <normalised orig="durtdauber" auto="true">dried pear</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.372

Out on it, says the king, ARMIN-E2-H,45.373

that is the foulest, ARMIN-E2-H,45.374

for <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> is <normalised orig="durty" auto="true">dirty</normalised> up to the elbows.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.375

I, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will; ARMIN-E2-H,45.376

but then he washes him <normalised orig="cleane" auto="true">clean</normalised> <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,45.377

and eats his <normalised orig="meate" auto="true">meat</normalised> cleanly enough.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.378

I promise thee, Will, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the king, thou <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised> a pretty foolish wit.
ARMIN-E2-H,45.379

I, Harry, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> he, ARMIN-E2-H,45.380

it will <normalised orig="serue" auto="true">serve</normalised> to make a wiser man than you a <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, $me $thinks
{TEXT:methinks}.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.381

At this the king <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,45.382

and <normalised orig="demaunds" auto="true">demands</normalised> the third question.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.383

Now, tell me, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> Will, if you can, what it is that, being borne
without life, head, <normalised orig="lippe" auto="true">lip</normalised>, or eye, yet doth <normalised orig="runne" auto="true">run</normalised> roaring through the
world till it dye.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.384

This is a wonder, quoth the king, and no question; ARMIN-E2-H,45.385

I know it not.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.386

Why, quoth Will, it is a fart.  ARMIN-E2-H,45.387

At this the king <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised> <normalised orig="hartely" auto="true">heartily</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,45.388

and was exceeding merry, ARMIN-E2-H,45.389

and bids Will <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised> any <normalised orig="reasinable" auto="true">reasonable</normalised> <P_46> thing, ARMIN-E2-H,46.390

and he would <normalised orig="graunt" auto="true">grant</normalised> it.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.391

Thanks, Harry, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> he; ARMIN-E2-H,46.392

now against I want, I know where to find it, ARMIN-E2-H,46.393

for yet I <normalised orig="neede" auto="true">need</normalised> nothing, ARMIN-E2-H,46.394

but one day I shall, ARMIN-E2-H,46.395

for <normalised orig="euery" auto="true">every</normalised> man sees his latter end, ARMIN-E2-H,46.396

but knows not his beginning.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.397

The king <normalised orig="understoode" auto="true">understood</normalised> his meaning, ARMIN-E2-H,46.398

and so pleasantly departed for that season, ARMIN-E2-H,46.399

and Will laid him <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> among the spaniels to <normalised orig="sleepe" auto="true">sleep</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.400

Of a time appointed the king dined at Windsor, in the <normalised orig="chappel" auto="true">chapel</normalised> yard at
<normalised orig="Cardinall" auto="true">Cardinal</normalised> <normalised orig="Wolsey's" auto="true">Walkway's</normalised>, at the same time when he was building that admirable
<normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised> of his <normalised orig="tombe" auto="true">tomb</normalised>: at whose gate <normalised orig="stoode" auto="true">stood</normalised> a number of <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> people,
to be <normalised orig="serued" auto="true">served</normalised> with alms when dinner was done within; ARMIN-E2-H,46.401

and, as Will passed by, they saluted him, taking him for a worthy
personage, which pleased him.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.402

In he comes, ARMIN-E2-H,46.403

and finding the king at dinner, and the <normalised orig="cardinall" auto="true">cardinal</normalised> by attending, to
disgrace him that he <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> <normalised orig="loued" auto="true">loved</normalised>, Harry, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,46.404

lend me ten pound.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.405

What to doe?  <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.406

To pay three or <normalised orig="foure" auto="true">four</normalised> of the <normalised orig="cardinall's" auto="true">cardinal's</normalised> creditors, quoth <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, to whom
my word is past, ARMIN-E2-H,46.407

and they are come now for the money.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.408

That thou shalt, Will, quoth <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.409

Creditors of mine?  <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the <normalised orig="cardinall" auto="true">cardinal</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,46.410

$I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised> {TEXT:Ile} give your grace my head if any man can justly <normalised orig="aske" auto="true">ask</normalised>
me a penny.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.411

No!  <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> Will.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.412

Lend me ten pounds; if I pay it not where thou <normalised orig="owest" auto="true">owe</normalised> it, $I $<normalised orig="'ll" auto="true">all</normalised>
{TEXT:Ile} give thee twenty for it.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.413

Doe so, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.414

That I will, my liege, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the <normalised orig="cardinall" auto="true">cardinal</normalised>, though I know I owe none.
ARMIN-E2-H,46.415

With that he lends Will ten pounds.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.416

Will goes to the gate, ARMIN-E2-H,46.417

distributes it to the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,46.418

and brought the empty bag.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.419

There is thy bag <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,46.420

thy creditors are satisfied, and my word out of danger.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.421

Who received?  <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> the king; the brewer or the baker?  ARMIN-E2-H,46.422

<normalised orig="Neyther" auto="true">Neither</normalised> <paren> Harry <$$paren>, <normalised orig="sayes" auto="true">says</normalised> Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,46.423

But, <normalised orig="cardinall" auto="true">cardinal</normalised>, <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> me in one thing: ARMIN-E2-H,46.424

to whom <normalised orig="dost" auto="true">dosed</normalised> thou owe thy <normalised orig="soule" auto="true">soul</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,46.425

his head is thine, ARMIN-E2-H,46.431

for to the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> at the gate I paid his debt, which <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> <normalised orig="yeelds" auto="true">yields</normalised> is due:

and what thou lendest to the <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> God will pay thee ten fold;
ARMIN-E2-H,47.436

he is my surety - ARMIN-E2-H,47.437

arrest him - ARMIN-E2-H,47.438

for, by my troth, hang <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> when I pay thee.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.439

The king <normalised orig="laught" auto="true">laughed</normalised> at the jest, ARMIN-E2-H,47.440

and so did the <normalised orig="cardinall" auto="true">cardinal</normalised> for a <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,47.441

but it grieved him to jest away ten pound so: ARMIN-E2-H,47.442

yet worse tricks then this Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> <normalised orig="serued" auto="true">served</normalised> him after,
ARMIN-E2-H,47.443

for <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> abide him, ARMIN-E2-H,47.444

and the forfeiture of his head had liked to <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> <normalised orig="beene" auto="true">been</normalised> payed, had <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>
not <normalised orig="poysoned" auto="true">poisoned</normalised> <normalised orig="himselfe" auto="true">himself</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.445

There was in the time of Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> another <normalised orig="artificiall" auto="true">artificial</normalised> <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, or
jester, in the court, whose <normalised orig="subtiltie" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> <normalised orig="heapt" auto="true">heaped</normalised> up wealth by gifts <normalised orig="giuen" auto="true">given</normalised> him,
for which Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> could <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> abide him; ARMIN-E2-H,47.446

but, <normalised orig="indeede" auto="true">indeed</normalised>, lightly one <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> $can $not {TEXT:cannot} <normalised orig="indure" auto="true">endure</normalised> the sight
of another, as Jack <normalised orig="Oates" auto="true">Oats</normalised>, the <normalised orig="minstrell" auto="true">minstrel</normalised>, in the fat <normalised orig="foole's" auto="true">fool's</normalised> story,
ARMIN-E2-H,47.447

and one beggar is woe that another by the <normalised orig="doore" auto="true">door</normalised> should <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,47.448

This jester was a big man, of a great <normalised orig="voyce" auto="true">voice</normalised>, long black locks, and a
<normalised orig="verry" auto="true">very</normalised> big, round beard.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.449

On a time, of purpose, Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> <normalised orig="watcht" auto="true">watched</normalised> to disgrace him, when he was
<normalised orig="jugling" auto="true">juggling</normalised> and jesting before the king.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.450

Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> brings up a <normalised orig="messe" auto="true">mess</normalised> of <normalised orig="milke" auto="true">milk</normalised> and a <normalised orig="manchet" auto="true">munched</normalised>: ARMIN-E2-H,47.451

Harry, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, lend me a <normalised orig="spoone" auto="true">spoon</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.452

<normalised orig="Foole" auto="true">Fool</normalised>, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the jester, use thy hands, ARMIN-E2-H,47.453

<normalised orig="helpe" auto="true">help</normalised> hands, ARMIN-E2-H,47.454

for I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> no lands, ARMIN-E2-H,47.455

and meant, that saying would warrant his <normalised orig="grose" auto="true">gross</normalised> feeding.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.456

I, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,47.457

beasts will doe so, ARMIN-E2-H,47.458

and beasts will bid others doe as they doe themselves.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.459

Will, said the king, thou <normalised orig="knowest" auto="true">know</normalised> I <normalised orig="haue" auto="true">have</normalised> none.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.460

True Harry, <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised>, ARMIN-E2-H,47.461

I know that, ARMIN-E2-H,47.462

therefore I <normalised orig="askt" auto="true">asked</normalised> thee; ARMIN-E2-H,47.463

and I would <paren> but for doing thee <normalised orig="harme" auto="true">harm</normalised> <$$paren> thou <normalised orig="hadst" auto="true">had</normalised> no
tongue to grant that <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised> his next <normalised orig="sute" auto="true">suit</normalised>; ARMIN-E2-H,47.464

but I must <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> my <normalised orig="creame" auto="true">cream</normalised> some way.  ARMIN-E2-H,47.465

The king, the jester, and all gathers about him to see him <normalised orig="eate" auto="true">eat</normalised> it.
ARMIN-E2-H,47.466

Will begins thus to rime <normalised orig="ouer" auto="true">over</normalised> his milk: {COM:verse_omitted} <P_48> Meaning
the <normalised orig="foole" auto="true">fool</normalised>, in whose beard and head the bread and milk was <normalised orig="thicke" auto="true">thick</normalised> <normalised orig="sowne" auto="true">sown</normalised>,
and his eyes almost put out.  ARMIN-E2-H,48.467

Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> gets him gone for <normalised orig="feare" auto="true">fear</normalised>.  ARMIN-E2-H,48.468

This lusty jester, forgetting himself, in fury draws his dagger,
ARMIN-E2-H,48.469

and <normalised orig="begings" auto="true">begins</normalised> {Q:typo?} to protest.  ARMIN-E2-H,48.470

Nay; <normalised orig="saies" auto="true">says</normalised> the king, are ye so <normalised orig="hote" auto="true">hot</normalised>?  ARMIN-E2-H,48.471

claps him fast, ARMIN-E2-H,48.472

and, though <normalised orig="hee" auto="true">hoe</normalised> draws his dagger here, makes him put it up in another
place.  ARMIN-E2-H,48.473

The <normalised orig="poore" auto="true">poor</normalised> abused jester was jested out of countenance, ARMIN-E2-H,48.474

and lay in <normalised orig="durance" auto="true">derange</normalised> a great while, till Will <normalised orig="Sommers" auto="true">Summers</normalised> was <normalised orig="faine" auto="true">fine</normalised>, after
he broke his head, to <normalised orig="giue" auto="true">give</normalised> him a <normalised orig="plaister" auto="true">plaster</normalised>, to get him out <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.
ARMIN-E2-H,48.475

But <normalised orig="neuer" auto="true">never</normalised> after came my <normalised orig="jugler" auto="true">juggler</normalised> in the court moore so <normalised orig="neere" auto="true">near</normalised> the king
, being such a dangerous man to draw in the presence of the king.
