<P_155>

<font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font> coming from the wars <paren> which were now ended
<$$paren> after he had made his court to his grandfather, he thought in
honour he ought to make a visit to <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, the daughter
of his foster-father, the dead general; and to make some excuses to her,
because his preservation was the occasion of her father's death; and to
present her with those slaves that had been taken in this last battle,
as the trophies of her father's victories.  BEHN-E3-H,155.2

When he came, attended by all the young soldiers of any merit, he was
infinitely <normalised orig="surpriz'd" auto="true">surprised</normalised> at the beauty of this fair Queen of Night, whose
face and person was so exceeding all he had ever beheld, BEHN-E3-H,155.3

that lovely modesty with which she <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> him, that softness in her look
and sighs, upon the melancholy occasion of this honour that was done by
so great a man as <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font>, and a prince of whom she had
heard such admirable things; the awfulness <normalised orig="wherewith" auto="true">whereat</normalised> she <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> him,
and the sweetness of her words and behaviour while he <normalised orig="stay'd" auto="true">stayed</normalised>, <normalised orig="gain'd" auto="true">gained</normalised> a
perfect conquest over his fierce heart, BEHN-E3-H,155.4

and made him feel, the victor <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> be <normalised orig="subdu'd" auto="true">subdued</normalised>.  So that having made
his first compliments, and presented her an hundred and fifty slaves in
fetters, he told her with his eyes, that he was not insensible of her
charms; while <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, who <normalised orig="wish'd" auto="true">wished</normalised> <P_156> for nothing
more than so glorious a conquest, was <normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised> to believe, she understood
that silent language of new-born love; and, from that moment, put on
all her additions to beauty.  BEHN-E3-H,156.5

The prince <normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised> to court with quite another humour than before;
BEHN-E3-H,156.6

and though he did not speak much of the fair <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>,
he had the pleasure to hear all his followers speak of nothing but the
charms of that maid, <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that, even in the presence of the old
king , they were extolling her, and <normalised orig="heightning" auto="true">heightening</normalised>, if {that_were} possible,
the beauties they had found in her: so that nothing else was <normalised orig="talk'd" auto="true">talked</normalised> of,
no other sound was heard in every corner where there were whisperers,
but <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised>!  <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised>!  <$$font> BEHN-E3-H,156.7

$<normalised orig="'T" auto="true">To</normalised> $will {TEXT:'Twill} be <normalised orig="imagin'd" auto="true">imagined</normalised> <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font> <normalised orig="stay'd" auto="true">stayed</normalised>
not long before he made his second visit; nor, considering his quality,
not much longer before he told her, he <normalised orig="ador'd" auto="true">adored</normalised> her.  BEHN-E3-H,156.8

I have often heard him say, that he <normalised orig="admir'd" auto="true">admired</normalised> by what strange inspiration
he came to talk things so soft, and so passionate, who never knew love,
nor was <normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> to the conversation of women; BEHN-E3-H,156.9

but <paren> to use his own words <$$paren> he said, most happily, some
new, and, till then, unknown power instructed his heart and tongue in
the language of love, and at the same time, in favour of him, <normalised orig="inspir'd" auto="true">inspired</normalised>
<font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> with a sense of his passion.  BEHN-E3-H,156.10

She was <normalised orig="touch'd" auto="true">touched</normalised> with what he said, BEHN-E3-H,156.11

and <normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised> it all in such answers as went to his very heart, with a
pleasure unknown before.  BEHN-E3-H,156.12

Nor did he use those obligations ill, that love had done him,
BEHN-E3-H,156.13

but <normalised orig="turn'd" auto="true">turned</normalised> all his happy moments to the best advantage; BEHN-E3-H,156.14

and as he knew no vice, his flame <normalised orig="aim'd" auto="true">aimed</normalised> at nothing but honour, if such
a distinction may be made in love; and especially in that country, where
men take to themselves as many as they can maintain; and where the only
crime and sin with woman, is, to turn her off, to abandon her to want,
shame and misery: BEHN-E3-H,156.15

such ill morals are only <normalised orig="practis'd" auto="true">practised</normalised> in Christian countries, where they
prefer the bare name of religion; and, without <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> or morality,
think that sufficient.  BEHN-E3-H,156.16

But <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font> was none of those <P_157> professors;
BEHN-E3-H,157.17

but as he had right notions of honour, so he made her such propositions
as were not only and barely such; BEHN-E3-H,157.18

but, contrary to the custom of his country, he made her vows, she
<normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be the only woman he <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> possess while he <normalised orig="liv'd" auto="true">lived</normalised>; that no age
or wrinkles <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> <normalised orig="encline" auto="true">incline</normalised> him to change; for her soul <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> be always
fine , and always young; and he <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> have an eternal idea in his mind
of the charms she now bore; and <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> look into his heart for that idea,
when he <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> find it no longer in her face.  BEHN-E3-H,157.19

After a thousand assurances of his lasting flame, and her eternal
empire over him, she condescended to receive him for her husband;
BEHN-E3-H,157.20

or rather, <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> him, as the greatest honour the gods <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> do her.
BEHN-E3-H,157.21

There is a certain ceremony in these cases to be <normalised orig="observ'd" auto="true">observed</normalised>, which I forgot
to ask how $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas} <normalised orig="perform'd" auto="true">performed</normalised>; BEHN-E3-H,157.22

but $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas} concluded on both sides, that in obedience to
him, the grandfather was to be first made acquainted with the design:
BEHN-E3-H,157.23

For they pay a most absolute resignation to the monarch, especially when
he is a parent also.  BEHN-E3-H,157.24

On the other side, the old king, who had many wives, and many concubines,
wanted not court-flatterers to insinuate into his heart a thousand tender
thoughts for this young beauty; and who represented her to his fancy,
as the most charming he had ever <normalised orig="possess'd" auto="true">possessed</normalised> in all the long race of his
numerous years.  BEHN-E3-H,157.25

At this character, his old heart, like an <normalised orig="extinguish'd" auto="true">extinguished</normalised> brand, most apt
to take fire, felt new sparks of love, BEHN-E3-H,157.26

and began to kindle; BEHN-E3-H,157.27

and now grown to his second childhood, <normalised orig="long'd" auto="true">longed</normalised> with impatience to
behold this gay thing, with whom, alas!  he could but innocently play.
BEHN-E3-H,157.28

But how he <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be <normalised orig="confirm'd" auto="true">confirmed</normalised> she was this wonder, before he <normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> his
power to call her to court, <paren> where maidens never came, unless for
the king's private use <$$paren> he was next to consider; BEHN-E3-H,157.29

and while he was so doing, he had intelligence brought him, that <font>
<normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> was most certainly mistress to the Prince <font>
<normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font>.  BEHN-E3-H,157.30

This gave him some <normalised orig="chagreen" auto="true">chagrin</normalised>: BEHN-E3-H,157.31

however, it gave him also an opportunity, one day, when the prince was a
hunting, to wait <P_158> on a man of quality, as his slave and attendant,
who should go and make a present to <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> , as from
the prince; BEHN-E3-H,158.32

he should then, unknown, see this fair maid, and have an opportunity to
hear what message she <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> return the prince for his present, and from
thence gather the state of her heart, and degree of her inclination.
BEHN-E3-H,158.33

This was put in execution, BEHN-E3-H,158.34

and the old monarch saw, BEHN-E3-H,158.35

and <normalised orig="burn'd" auto="true">burned</normalised>: BEHN-E3-H,158.36

He found her all he had heard, BEHN-E3-H,158.37

and would not delay his happiness, BEHN-E3-H,158.38

but found he should have some obstacle to overcome her heart;
BEHN-E3-H,158.39

for she <normalised orig="express'd" auto="true">expressed</normalised> her sense of the present the prince had sent her,
in terms so sweet, so soft and pretty, with an air of love and joy that
<normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not be dissembled, <normalised orig="insomuch" auto="true">inasmuch</normalised> that $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas} past doubt
whether she <normalised orig="lov'd" auto="true">loved</normalised> <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font> entirely.  BEHN-E3-H,158.40

This gave the old king some affliction; BEHN-E3-H,158.41

but he <normalised orig="salv'd" auto="true">salved</normalised> it with this, that the obedience the people pay their king ,
was not at all <normalised orig="inferiour" auto="true">inferior</normalised> to what they paid their gods; BEHN-E3-H,158.42

and what love <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> not oblige <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> to do, duty <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised>
compel her to.  BEHN-E3-H,158.43

He was therefore no sooner got to his apartment, but he sent the royal
veil to <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>; that is, the ceremony of invitation :
BEHN-E3-H,158.44

He sends the lady he has a mind to honour with his bed, a veil, with
which she is <normalised orig="cover'd" auto="true">covered</normalised>, and <normalised orig="secur'd" auto="true">secured</normalised> for the king's use; BEHN-E3-H,158.45

and $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} death to disobey; besides, held a most impious
disobedience.  BEHN-E3-H,158.46

$<normalised orig="'T" auto="true">To</normalised> $is {TEXT:'Tis} not to be <normalised orig="imagin'd" auto="true">imagined</normalised> the <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised> and grief that <normalised orig="seiz'd" auto="true">seized</normalised>
the lovely maid at this news and sight.  BEHN-E3-H,158.47

However, as delays in these cases are dangerous, and pleading worse than
treason; trembling, and almost fainting, she was <normalised orig="oblig'd" auto="true">obliged</normalised> to suffer her
self to be <normalised orig="cover'd" auto="true">covered</normalised>, and led away.  BEHN-E3-H,158.48

They brought her thus to court; BEHN-E3-H,158.49

and the king, who had <normalised orig="caus'd" auto="true">cause</normalised> a very rich bath to be <normalised orig="prepar'd" auto="true">prepared</normalised>, was led into
it, where he sate under a canopy, in state, to receive this long'd-for
virgin; whom he having commanded <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be brought to him, they <paren>
after disrobing her <$$paren> led her to the bath, and making fast the
doors, left her to descend.  BEHN-E3-H,158.50

The king, without more courtship, bad her throw off her mantle, and come
to his <P_159> arms.  BEHN-E3-H,159.51

But <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, all in tears, threw her self on the marble ,
on the brink of the bath, BEHN-E3-H,159.52

and besought him to hear her.  BEHN-E3-H,159.53

She told him, as she was a maid, how proud of the divine glory she should
have been, of having it in her power to oblige her king; BEHN-E3-H,159.54

but as by the laws he could not, and from his royal goodness would not
take from any man his wedded wife; so she <normalised orig="believ'd" auto="true">believed</normalised> she <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> be the
occasion of making him commit a great sin, if she did not reveal her
state and condition; and tell him, she was <normalised orig="another's" auto="true">another</normalised>, and <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not be
so happy to be his.  BEHN-E3-H,159.55

The king, <normalised orig="enrag'd" auto="true">enraged</normalised> at this delay, hastily demanded the name of the
bold man, that had married a woman of her degree, without his consent.
BEHN-E3-H,159.56

<font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, seeing his eyes fierce, and his hands tremble ,
<paren> whether with age or anger, I know not, but she <normalised orig="fancy'd" auto="true">fancied</normalised> the last
<$$paren> almost repented she had said so much, BEHN-E3-H,159.57

for now she <normalised orig="fear'd" auto="true">feared</normalised> the storm <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> fall on the prince; BEHN-E3-H,159.58

she therefore said a thousand things to appease the raging of his flame,
and to prepare him to hear who it was with calmness: BEHN-E3-H,159.59

but before she spoke, he <normalised orig="imagin'd" auto="true">imagined</normalised> who she meant, BEHN-E3-H,159.60

but <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> not seem to do so, BEHN-E3-H,159.61

but commanded her to lay aside her mantle, and suffer her self to receive
his caresses, BEHN-E3-H,159.62

or, by his gods he swore, that happy man whom she was going to name
<normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> die, though it were even <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font> himself.
BEHN-E3-H,159.63

<font> Therefore <$$font> <paren> said he <$$paren> <font> deny this
marriage, BEHN-E3-H,159.64

and swear thy self a maid.  BEHN-E3-H,159.65

That <$$font> <paren> <normalised orig="reply'd" auto="true">replied</normalised> <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> <$$paren> <font>
by all our powers I do; BEHN-E3-H,159.66

for I am not yet known to my husband.  BEHN-E3-H,159.67

$<normalised orig="'T" auto="true">To</normalised> $is {TEXT:'Tis} enough <$$font> <paren> said the King; <$$paren>
BEHN-E3-H,159.68

<font> $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} enough both to satisfy my conscience, and
my heart.  <$$font> BEHN-E3-H,159.69

And rising from his seat, he went BEHN-E3-H,159.70

and led her into the bath; it being in vain for her to resist.
BEHN-E3-H,159.71

In this time, the prince, who was <normalised orig="return'd" auto="true">returned</normalised> from hunting, went to visit
his <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, BEHN-E3-H,159.72

but found her gone; and not only so, BEHN-E3-H,159.73

but heard she had <normalised orig="receiv'd" auto="true">received</normalised> the royal veil.  BEHN-E3-H,159.74

This <normalised orig="rais'd" auto="true">raised</normalised> him to a storm; BEHN-E3-H,159.75

and in his madness, they had much ado to save him from laying violent
hands on himself.  BEHN-E3-H,159.76

Force first <normalised orig="prevail'd" auto="true">prevailed</normalised>, and then reason: BEHN-E3-H,159.77

They <normalised orig="urg'd" auto="true">urged</normalised> all to him, that might oppose his <P_160> rage;
BEHN-E3-H,160.78

but nothing <normalised orig="weigh'd" auto="true">weighed</normalised> so greatly with him as the king's old age, <normalised orig="uncapable" auto="true">incapable</normalised>
of injuring him with <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>.  BEHN-E3-H,160.79

He <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> give way to that hope, because it <normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised> him most, and <normalised orig="flatter'd" auto="true">flattered</normalised>
best his heart.  BEHN-E3-H,160.80

Yet this <normalised orig="serv'd" auto="true">served</normalised> not altogether to make him cease his different
passions , which sometimes <normalised orig="rag'd" auto="true">raged</normalised> within him, and <normalised orig="softned" auto="true">softened</normalised> into showers.
BEHN-E3-H,160.81

$<normalised orig="'T" auto="true">To</normalised> $was {TEXT:'Twas} not enough to appease him, to tell him, his
grandfather was old, and <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not that way injure him, while he
<normalised orig="retain'd" auto="true">retained</normalised> that awful duty which the young men are <normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> there to pay to
their grave relations.  BEHN-E3-H,160.82

He <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not be <normalised orig="convinc'd" auto="true">convinced</normalised> he had no cause to sigh and mourn for the loss
of a mistress, he <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not with all his strength and courage retrieve.
BEHN-E3-H,160.83

And he <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> often cry, <font> Oh, my friends!  BEHN-E3-H,160.84

were she in <normalised orig="wall'd" auto="true">walled</normalised> cities, or <normalised orig="confin'd" auto="true">confined</normalised> from me in fortifications of
the greatest strength; did <normalised orig="inchantments" auto="true">enchantments</normalised> or monsters detain her from me;
I <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> venture through any hazard to free her: BEHN-E3-H,160.85

But here, in the arms of a feeble old man, my youth, my violent love , my
trade in arms, and all my vast desire of glory, avail me nothing <$$font>.
BEHN-E3-H,160.86

<normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <font> is as <normalised orig="irrecoverably" auto="true">irrecoverable</normalised> lost to me, as if she were <normalised orig="snatch'd" auto="true">snatched</normalised>
by the cold arms of death: BEHN-E3-H,160.87

Oh!  she is never to be <normalised orig="retriev'd" auto="true">retrieved</normalised>.  BEHN-E3-H,160.88

If I <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> wait tedious years, till fate <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> bow the old king to
his grave, even that <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> not leave me <$$font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <font> free;
BEHN-E3-H,160.89

but still that custom that makes it so vile a crime for a son to marry
his father's wives or mistresses, <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> hinder my happiness; unless I
<normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> either ignobly set an ill precedent to my successors, or abandon my
country, and fly with her to some unknown world who never heard our story.
<$$font> BEHN-E3-H,160.90

But it was objected to him, That his case was not the same; for <font>
<normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> being his lawful wife by solemn contract, $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was
{TEXT:'twas} he was the <normalised orig="injur'd" auto="true">injured</normalised> man, and might, if he so <normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised>,
take <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> back, the breach of the law being on his
grandfather's side; and that if he <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> circumvent him, and redeem
her from the <normalised orig="otan" auto="true">oaten</normalised>, which is the Palace of the King's Women, a sort of
seraglio, it was both just and lawful for him so to do.  BEHN-E3-H,160.91

This reasoning had some force upon him, BEHN-E3-H,160.92

and he <P_161> <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> have been entirely comforted, but for the thought
that she was <normalised orig="possess'd" auto="true">possessed</normalised> by his grandfather.  BEHN-E3-H,161.93

However, he <normalised orig="lov'd" auto="true">loved</normalised> so well, that he was <normalised orig="resolv'd" auto="true">resolved</normalised> to believe what most
<normalised orig="favour'd" auto="true">favoured</normalised> his hope, and to endeavour to learn from <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda's" auto="true">Amount's</normalised>
<$$font> own mouth, what only she <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> satisfy him in, whether she
was <normalised orig="robb'd" auto="true">robbed</normalised> of that blessing which was only due to his faith and love.
BEHN-E3-H,161.94

But as it was very hard to get a sight of the women, <paren> for no men
ever <normalised orig="enter'd" auto="true">entered</normalised> into the <normalised orig="otan" auto="true">oaten</normalised>, but when the king went to entertain himself
with some one of his wives or mistresses; and $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas}
death, at any other time, for any other to go in <$$paren> so he knew
not how to contrive to get a sight of her.  BEHN-E3-H,161.95

While <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font> felt all the agonies of love, and <normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised>
under a torment the most painful in the world, the old king was not
exempted from his share of affliction.  BEHN-E3-H,161.96

He was troubled, BEHN-E3-H,161.97

for having been <normalised orig="forc'd" auto="true">forced</normalised>, by an irresistible passion, to rob his son
of a treasure, he knew, <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not but be extremely dear to him; since
she was the most beautiful that ever had been seen, and had besides,
all the sweetness and innocence of youth and modesty, with a charm of
wit surpassing all.  BEHN-E3-H,161.98

He found, that however she was <normalised orig="forc'd" auto="true">forced</normalised> to expose her lovely person to his
<normalised orig="wither'd" auto="true">withered</normalised> arms, she <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> only sigh and weep there, and think of <font>
<normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font>; BEHN-E3-H,161.99

and oftentimes <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not forbear speaking of him, tho her life were,
by custom, forfeited by owning her passion.  BEHN-E3-H,161.100

But she spoke not of a lover only, but of a prince dear to him to whom
she spoke; and of the praises of a man, who, till now, <normalised orig="fill'd" auto="true">filled</normalised> the old
man's soul with joy at every recital of his bravery, or even his name.
BEHN-E3-H,161.101

And $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $was {TEXT:'twas} this dotage on our young hero, that gave
<font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> a thousand privileges to speak of him, without
offending; and this condescension in the old king, that made her take
the satisfaction of speaking of him so very often.  BEHN-E3-H,161.102

Besides, he many times <normalised orig="enquir'd" auto="true">enquired</normalised> how the prince bore himself:
BEHN-E3-H,161.103

And those of whom he <normalised orig="ask'd" auto="true">asked</normalised>, being entirely slaves to the merits and
<normalised orig="vertues" auto="true">virtues</normalised> of the prince, still <normalised orig="answer'd" auto="true">answered</normalised> what they thought <normalised orig="conduc'd" auto="true">conduced</normalised> best
to his <P_162> service; which was, to make the old king fancy that the
prince had no more interest in <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, and had <normalised orig="resign'd" auto="true">resigned</normalised>
her willingly to the pleasure of the king; that he diverted himself with
his mathematicians, his fortifications, his officers and his hunting.
BEHN-E3-H,162.104

This <normalised orig="pleas'd" auto="true">pleased</normalised> the old lover, who <normalised orig="fail'd" auto="true">failed</normalised> not to report these things
again to <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, that she might, by the example of her
young lover, withdraw her heart, and rest better contented in his arms.
BEHN-E3-H,162.105

But, however she was <normalised orig="forc'd" auto="true">forced</normalised> to receive this unwelcome news, in all
appearance, with unconcern and content; her heart was bursting within ,
BEHN-E3-H,162.106

and she was only happy when she <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> get alone, to vent her griefs and
moans with sighs and tears.  BEHN-E3-H,162.107

<P_186>

For the future therefore I must call <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> Caesar <$$font>
, since by that name only he was known in our western world,
BEHN-E3-H,186.109

and by that name he was received on shore at <font> <normalised orig="Parham" auto="true">Pram</normalised> House <$$font>
, where he was <normalised orig="destin'd" auto="true">destined</normalised> a slave.  BEHN-E3-H,186.110

But if the king himself <paren> God bless him <$$paren> had come
ashore, there <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not have been greater expectation by all the whole
plantation, and those neighbouring ones, than was on ours at that time ;
BEHN-E3-H,186.111

and he was received more like a <normalised orig="governour" auto="true">governor</normalised> than a slave: BEHN-E3-H,186.112

notwithstanding, as the custom was, they assigned him his portion of land,
his house and his business up in the plantation.  BEHN-E3-H,186.113

But as it was more for form, than any design to put him to his task,
he endured no more of the slave but the name, BEHN-E3-H,186.114

and <normalised orig="remain'd" auto="true">remained</normalised> some days in the house, receiving all visits that were
made him, without stirring towards that part of the plantation where
the negroes were.  BEHN-E3-H,186.115

At last, he <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> needs go view his land, his house, and the business
<normalised orig="assign'd" auto="true">assigned</normalised> him.  BEHN-E3-H,186.116

But he no sooner came <P_187> to the houses of the slaves, which are
like a little town by it self, the negroes all having left work, but
they all came forth to behold him, BEHN-E3-H,187.117

and found he was that prince who had, at several times, sold most of
<normalised orig="'em" auto="true">em</normalised> to these parts; BEHN-E3-H,187.118

and from a veneration they pay to great men, especially if they know
<normalised orig="'em" auto="true">em</normalised>, and from the <normalised orig="surprize" auto="true">surprise</normalised> and awe they had at the sight of him, they
all cast themselves at his feet, crying out, in their language, <font>
Live, O King!  BEHN-E3-H,187.119

Long live, O King!  <$$font> BEHN-E3-H,187.120

and kissing his feet, paid him even divine homage.  BEHN-E3-H,187.121

Several <font> English <$$font> gentlemen were with him, BEHN-E3-H,187.122

and what Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> had <normalised orig="told'em" auto="true">telethon</normalised> was here <normalised orig="confirm'd" auto="true">confirmed</normalised>
; of which he himself before had no other witness than <font> Caesar
<$$font> himself: BEHN-E3-H,187.123

But he was infinitely glad to find his grandeur confirmed by the adoration
of all the slaves.  BEHN-E3-H,187.124

<font> Caesar <$$font> troubled with their over-joy, and over-ceremony ,
<normalised orig="besought'em" auto="true">begotten</normalised> to rise, and to receive him as their fellow-slave; assuring
them he was no better.  At which they set up with one accord a most
terrible and hideous mourning and condoling, which he and the <font>
English <$$font> had much ado to appease: BEHN-E3-H,187.125

but at last they prevailed <normalised orig="with'em" auto="true">within</normalised>, BEHN-E3-H,187.126

and they prepared all their barbarous <normalised orig="musick" auto="true">music</normalised>, BEHN-E3-H,187.127

and every one <normalised orig="kill'd" auto="true">killed</normalised> and <normalised orig="dress'd" auto="true">dressed</normalised> something of his own stock
BEHN-E3-H,187.128

<paren> for every family has their land apart, on which, at their
leisure-times, they breed all eatable things <$$paren> BEHN-E3-H,187.129

and clubbing it together, made a most magnificent supper, inviting
their grandee captain, their prince, to honour it with his <normalised orig="precence" auto="true">presence</normalised>;
which he did, and several <font> English <$$font> with him, where they
all waited on him, some playing, others dancing before him all the time,
according to the manners of their several nations, and with <normalised orig="unweary'd" auto="true">unwearied</normalised>
industry endeavouring to please and delight him.  BEHN-E3-H,187.130

While they sat at meat, Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> told <font>
Caesar <$$font>, that most of these young slaves were undone in love
with a fine she-slave, whom they had had about six months on their land
; BEHN-E3-H,187.131

the prince, who never heard the name of love without a sigh, nor any
mention of it without the curiosity of examining further into that tale,
which <P_188> of all discourses was most agreeable to him, asked, how
they came to be so unhappy, as to be all undone for one fair slave?
BEHN-E3-H,188.132

<font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font>, who was naturally amorous, and <normalised orig="lov'd" auto="true">loved</normalised> to talk
of love as well as any body, proceeded to tell him, they had the most
charming black that ever was beheld on their plantation, about fifteen or
sixteen years old, as he <normalised orig="guess'd" auto="true">guessed</normalised>; that for his part he had done nothing
but sigh for her ever since she came; and that all the white beauties he
had seen, never <normalised orig="charm'd" auto="true">charmed</normalised> him so absolutely as this fine creature had done
; and that no man, of any nation, ever beheld her that did not fall in
love with her; and that she had all the slaves perpetually at her feet;
and the whole country resounded with the fame of <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised> <$$font>
, BEHN-E3-H,188.133

for so <paren> said he <$$paren> we have <normalised orig="christen'd" auto="true">christened</normalised> her: BEHN-E3-H,188.134

but she denies us all with such a noble disdain, that $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis}
a miracle to see, that she who can give such eternal desires, should
her self be all ice and all unconcern.  BEHN-E3-H,188.135

She is <normalised orig="adorn'd" auto="true">adorned</normalised> with the most graceful modesty that ever <normalised orig="beautify'd" auto="true">beautified</normalised> youth;
the softest <normalised orig="sigher" auto="true">shower</normalised> - that, if she were capable of love, one would swear
she languished for some absent happy man; and so retired, as if she
<normalised orig="fear'd" auto="true">feared</normalised> a rape even from the god of day, or that the breezes <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> steal
kisses from her delicate mouth.  BEHN-E3-H,188.136

Her task of work, some sighing lover every day makes it his petition to
perform for her; which she accepts blushing, and with <normalised orig="reluctancy" auto="true">reluctance</normalised>, for
fear he will ask her a look for a <normalised orig="recompence" auto="true">recompense</normalised>, which he dares not presume
to hope; so great an awe she strikes into the hearts of her admirers.
BEHN-E3-H,188.137

<font> I do not wonder <$$font> <paren> <normalised orig="reply'd" auto="true">replied</normalised> the prince <$$paren>
<font> that <$$font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised> <font> should refuse slaves, being, as you
say, so beautiful; BEHN-E3-H,188.138

but wonder how she escapes those that can entertain her as you can do: or
why, being your slave, you do not oblige her to yield?  BEHN-E3-H,188.139

I confess <$$font> <paren> said <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> <$$paren> <font>
when I have, against her will, entertained her with love so long, as to
be transported with my passion even above decency, I have been ready to
make use of those advantages of strength and force nature has given me:
BEHN-E3-H,188.140

But oh!  she disarms me with that modesty and weeping, so tender and
so moving, that <P_189> I retire, and thank my stars she overcame me.
<$$font> BEHN-E3-H,189.141

The company <normalised orig="laugh'd" auto="true">laughed</normalised> at his civility to a slave, BEHN-E3-H,189.142

and <font> Caesar <$$font> only applauded the nobleness of his passion
and nature, since that slave might be noble, or, what was better, have
true notions of honour and <normalised orig="vertue" auto="true">virtue</normalised> in her.  BEHN-E3-H,189.143

Thus passed they this night, after having received from the slaves all
imaginable respect and obedience.  BEHN-E3-H,189.144

The next day, <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> <normalised orig="ask'd" auto="true">asked</normalised> <font> Caesar <$$font> to
walk when the heat was <normalised orig="allay'd" auto="true">allayed</normalised>, BEHN-E3-H,189.145

and <normalised orig="designedly" auto="true">decently</normalised> <normalised orig="carry'd" auto="true">carried</normalised> him by the cottage of the fair slave;
BEHN-E3-H,189.146

and told him she whom he spoke of last night lived there <normalised orig="retir'd" auto="true">retired</normalised>:
BEHN-E3-H,189.147

<font> But <$$font> <paren> says he <$$paren> <font> I would not wish
you to approach; BEHN-E3-H,189.148

for I am sure you will be in love as soon as you behold her.  <$$font>
BEHN-E3-H,189.149

<font> Caesar <$$font> assured him, he was proof against all the charms
of that sex; and that if he imagined his heart could be so perfidious
to love again, after <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, he believed he should tear
it from his bosom.  BEHN-E3-H,189.150

They had no sooner spoke, but a little shock-dog, that <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised>
<$$font> had presented her, which she took great delight in, ran out;
BEHN-E3-H,189.151

and she, not knowing any body was there, ran to get it in again,
BEHN-E3-H,189.152

and bolted out on those who were just speaking of her: when seeing them,
she would have run in again, BEHN-E3-H,189.153

but <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> caught her by the hand, BEHN-E3-H,189.154

and <normalised orig="cry'd" auto="true">cried</normalised>, <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised>, <font> however you fly a lover, you ought to pay
some respect to this stranger <$$font>, <paren> pointing to <font>
Caesar <$$font>.  <$$paren> BEHN-E3-H,189.155

But she, as if she had resolved never to raise her eyes to the face of a
man again, <normalised orig="bent'em" auto="true">bantam</normalised> the more to the earth, when he spoke, BEHN-E3-H,189.156

and gave the prince the leisure to look the more at her.
BEHN-E3-H,189.157

There needed no long gazing, or consideration, to examine who this fair
creature was; BEHN-E3-H,189.158

he soon saw <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> all over her; BEHN-E3-H,189.159

in a minute he saw her face, her shape, her air, her modesty,
BEHN-E3-H,189.160

and all that <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> forth his soul with joy at his eyes, BEHN-E3-H,189.161

and left his body destitute of almost life: BEHN-E3-H,189.162

it stood without motion, BEHN-E3-H,189.163

and for a minute knew not that it had a being; BEHN-E3-H,189.164

and, I believe, he had never come to himself, so <normalised orig="oppress'd" auto="true">oppressed</normalised> he was with
over-joy, if he had not met with this allay, that he perceived <font>
<normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font> fall dead in the hands of <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font>.
BEHN-E3-H,189.165

This <normalised orig="awaken'd" auto="true">awakened</normalised> him, BEHN-E3-H,189.166

and he ran to her aid, BEHN-E3-H,189.167

and caught her in his arms, <P_190> where by degrees she came to her
self; BEHN-E3-H,190.168

and $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} needless to tell with what transports, what
<normalised orig="exstasies" auto="true">ecstasies</normalised> of joy, they both awhile beheld each other, without speaking ;
BEHN-E3-H,190.169

then snatched each other to their arms; BEHN-E3-H,190.170

then gaze again, as if they still doubted whether they <normalised orig="possess'd" auto="true">possessed</normalised> the
blessing they grasped: BEHN-E3-H,190.171

but when they <normalised orig="recover'd" auto="true">recovered</normalised> their speech, $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $is {TEXT:'tis} not to be
imagined what tender things they <normalised orig="express'd" auto="true">expressed</normalised> to each other; <normalised orig="wondring" auto="true">wondering</normalised> what
strange fate had brought them again together.  BEHN-E3-H,190.172

They soon <normalised orig="inform'd" auto="true">informed</normalised> each other of their fortunes, BEHN-E3-H,190.173

and equally <normalised orig="bewail'd" auto="true">bewailed</normalised> their fate; BEHN-E3-H,190.174

but at the same time they mutually protested, that even fetters and
slavery were soft and easy, and would be supported with joy and pleasure
, while they <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> be so happy to possess each other, and to be able to
make good their vows.  BEHN-E3-H,190.175

<font> Caesar <$$font> swore he disdained the empire of the world,
while he could behold his <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>; BEHN-E3-H,190.176

and she despised grandeur and pomp, those vanities of her sex, when she
could gaze on <font> <normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font>.  BEHN-E3-H,190.177

He <normalised orig="ador'd" auto="true">adored</normalised> the very cottage where she resided, BEHN-E3-H,190.178

and said, That little inch of the world would give him more happiness
than all the universe <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> do; BEHN-E3-H,190.179

and she <normalised orig="vow'd" auto="true">vowed</normalised>, it was a palace, while adorned with the presence of <font>
<normalised orig="Oroonoko" auto="true">Erroneous</normalised> <$$font>.  BEHN-E3-H,190.180

<font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> was infinitely pleased with this novel,
BEHN-E3-H,190.181

and found this <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised> <$$font> was the fair mistress of whom
<font> Caesar <$$font> had before spoke; BEHN-E3-H,190.182

and was not a little <normalised orig="satisfy'd" auto="true">satisfied</normalised>, that heaven was so kind to the prince
as to sweeten his misfortunes by so lucky an accident; BEHN-E3-H,190.183

and leaving the lovers to themselves, was impatient to come down to <font>
<normalised orig="Parham" auto="true">Pram</normalised> House <$$font> <paren> which was on the same plantation <$$paren>
to give me an account of what had <normalised orig="hapned" auto="true">happened</normalised>.  BEHN-E3-H,190.184

I was as impatient to make these lovers a visit, having already made a
friendship with <font> Caesar <$$font>, BEHN-E3-H,190.185

and from his own mouth learned what I have related; which was confirmed
by his <font> Frenchman <$$font>, who was set on shore to seek his
fortune, and of whom they <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not make a slave, because a Christian ;
BEHN-E3-H,190.186

and he came daily to <font> <normalised orig="Parham" auto="true">Pram</normalised> Hill <$$font> to see and pay his
respects to his pupil prince.  So that concerning and interesting my
self in all that related to <P_191> <font> Caesar <$$font>, whom I had
assured of liberty as soon as the <normalised orig="governour" auto="true">governor</normalised> arrived, I hasted presently
to the place where these lovers were, BEHN-E3-H,191.187

and was infinitely glad to find this beautiful young slave <paren> who
had already <normalised orig="gain'd" auto="true">gained</normalised> all our esteems, for her modesty and her extraordinary
prettiness <$$paren> to be the same I had heard <font> Caesar <$$font>
speak so much of.  BEHN-E3-H,191.188

One may imagine then we paid her a treble respect; BEHN-E3-H,191.189

and tho from her being carved in fine flowers and birds all over her body
, we took her to be of quality before, yet when we knew <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised>
<$$font> was <font> <normalised orig="Imoinda" auto="true">Amanda</normalised> <$$font>, we could not enough admire her.
BEHN-E3-H,191.190

I had forgot to tell you, that those who are nobly born of that country ,
are so delicately cut and raised all over the fore-part of the trunk of
their bodies that it looks as if it were <normalised orig="japan'd" auto="true">japaned</normalised>, the works being raised
like high point round the edges of the flowers.  BEHN-E3-H,191.191

Some are only carved with a little flower, or bird, at the sides of the
temples, as was <font> Caesar <$$font>; BEHN-E3-H,191.192

and those who are so carved over the body, resemble our <normalised orig="antient" auto="true">ancient</normalised> <font>
<normalised orig="Picts" auto="true">Pests</normalised> <$$font> that are <normalised orig="figur'd" auto="true">figured</normalised> in the chronicles, BEHN-E3-H,191.193

but these carvings are more delicate.  BEHN-E3-H,191.194

From that happy day <font> Caesar <$$font> took <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised> <$$font>
for his wife, to the general joy of all people; BEHN-E3-H,191.195

and there was as much magnificence as the country would afford at the
celebration of this wedding: BEHN-E3-H,191.196

and in a very short time after she conceived with child, which made <font>
Caesar <$$font> even adore her, knowing he was the last of his great race.
BEHN-E3-H,191.197

This new accident made him more impatient of liberty, BEHN-E3-H,191.198

and he was every day treating with <font> <normalised orig="Trefry" auto="true">Trevor</normalised> <$$font> for his and
<font> <normalised orig="Clemene's" auto="true">Calamine's</normalised> <$$font> liberty BEHN-E3-H,191.199

and <normalised orig="offer'd" auto="true">offered</normalised> either gold, or a vast quantity of slaves, which should be
paid before they let him go, provided he could have any security that
he should go when his ransom was paid.  BEHN-E3-H,191.200

They fed him from day to day with promises, BEHN-E3-H,191.201

and <normalised orig="delay'd" auto="true">delayed</normalised> him till the <normalised orig="Lord-Governour" auto="true">lord-governor</normalised> should come; so that he began
to suspect them of <normalised orig="falshood" auto="true">falsehood</normalised>, and that they would delay him till the time
of his wife's delivery and make a slave of that too: BEHN-E3-H,191.202

for all the breed is theirs to whom the parents belong.  BEHN-E3-H,191.203

This thought made him very <P_192> uneasy, BEHN-E3-H,192.204

and his sullenness gave them some jealousies of him; so that I was
obliged, by some persons who <normalised orig="fear'd" auto="true">feared</normalised> a mutiny <paren> which is very
fatal sometimes in those colonies that abound so with slaves, that they
exceed the whites in vast numbers <$$paren> to discourse with <font>
Caesar <$$font>, and to give him all the satisfaction I possibly could :
BEHN-E3-H,192.205

They knew he and <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised> <$$font> were scarce an hour in a day
from my lodgings; that they eat with me, and that I <normalised orig="oblig'd'em" auto="true">obligation</normalised> in all
things I was capable of.  BEHN-E3-H,192.206

I entertained them with the loves of the <font> Romans <$$font>, and
great men, which charmed him to my company; and her, with teaching her
all the pretty works that I was mistress of, and telling her stories
of nuns, and endeavouring to bring her to the <normalised orig="knowledg" auto="true">knowledge</normalised> of the true God:
BEHN-E3-H,192.207

But of all discourses, <font> Caesar <$$font> liked that the worst,
BEHN-E3-H,192.208

and would never be reconciled to our notions of the Trinity, of which
he ever made a jest; BEHN-E3-H,192.209

it was a riddle he said would turn his brain to conceive,
BEHN-E3-H,192.210

and one <normalised orig="cou'd" auto="true">could</normalised> not make him understand what faith was.  BEHN-E3-H,192.211

However, these conversations <normalised orig="fail'd" auto="true">failed</normalised> not altogether so well to divert him ,
that he liked the company of us women much above men, BEHN-E3-H,192.212

for he could not drink, BEHN-E3-H,192.213

and he is but an ill companion in that country that $can $not
{TEXT:cannot}.  So that obliging him to love us very well, we had all
the liberty of speech with him, especially my self, whom he <normalised orig="call'd" auto="true">called</normalised> his
great Mistress; BEHN-E3-H,192.214

and indeed my word would go a great way with him.  BEHN-E3-H,192.215

For these reasons I had opportunity to take notice to him, that he was not
well pleased of late, as he used to be; was more retired and thoughtful;
BEHN-E3-H,192.216

and told him, I took it ill he <normalised orig="shou'd" auto="true">should</normalised> suspect we <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> break our words
with him, and not permit both him and <font> <normalised orig="Clemene" auto="true">Calamine</normalised> <$$font> to return
to his own kingdom, which was not so long a way, BEHN-E3-H,192.217

but when he was once on his voyage he <normalised orig="wou'd" auto="true">would</normalised> quickly arrive there.
BEHN-E3-H,192.218

He made me some answers that <normalised orig="shew'd" auto="true">showed</normalised> a doubt in him, which made me ask,
what advantage it would be to doubt?  BEHN-E3-H,192.219

It would but give us a fear of him, BEHN-E3-H,192.220

and possibly compel us to treat him so as I should be very <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to behold
: that is, it might occasion his confinement.  BEHN-E3-H,192.221

Perhaps <P_193> this was not so luckily spoke of me, BEHN-E3-H,193.222

for I <normalised orig="perceiv'd" auto="true">perceived</normalised> he resented that word, which I strove to soften again
in vain: BEHN-E3-H,193.223

However, he <normalised orig="assur'd" auto="true">assured</normalised> me, that whatsoever resolutions he should take,
he would act nothing upon the white people; BEHN-E3-H,193.224

and as for my self, and those upon that plantation where he was, he
would sooner forfeit his eternal liberty, and life it self, than lift
his hand against his greatest enemy on that place.  BEHN-E3-H,193.225

He besought me to suffer no fears upon his account, BEHN-E3-H,193.226

for he could do nothing that honour should not dictate; BEHN-E3-H,193.227

but he <normalised orig="accus'd" auto="true">accused</normalised> himself for having <normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised> slavery so long:
BEHN-E3-H,193.228

yet he <normalised orig="charg'd" auto="true">charged</normalised> that weakness on love alone, who was capable of making
him neglect even glory it self; and, for which, now he reproaches himself
every moment of the day.  BEHN-E3-H,193.229

Much more to this effect he spoke, with an air impatient enough to make
me know he would not be long in bondage; BEHN-E3-H,193.230

and though he <normalised orig="suffer'd" auto="true">suffered</normalised> only the name of a slave, and had nothing of the
toil and labour of one, yet that was sufficient to render him uneasy;
BEHN-E3-H,193.231

and he had been too long idle, who <normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> to be always in action, and
in arms.  BEHN-E3-H,193.232

He had a spirit all rough and fierce, and that could not be <normalised orig="tam'd" auto="true">tamed</normalised> to
lazy rest; BEHN-E3-H,193.233

and though all endeavours were <normalised orig="us'd" auto="true">used</normalised> to exercise himself in such actions
and sports as this world afforded, as running, wrestling, pitching the
bar, hunting and fishing, chasing and killing <normalised orig="tygers" auto="true">tigers</normalised> of a monstrous
size, which this continent affords in abundance; and wonderful snakes,
such as <font> Alexander <$$font> is reported to have <normalised orig="encounter'd" auto="true">encountered</normalised> at
the river of <font> Amazons <$$font>, and which <font> Caesar <$$font>
took great delight to overcome; yet these were not actions great enough
for his large soul, which was still panting after more <normalised orig="renown'd" auto="true">renowned</normalised> actions.
BEHN-E3-H,193.234

Before I parted that day with him, I got, with much-ado, a promise from
him to rest yet a little longer with patience, and wait the coming of the
Lord <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised>, who was every day expected on our shore: BEHN-E3-H,193.235

he <normalised orig="assur'd" auto="true">assured</normalised> me he would, BEHN-E3-H,193.236

and this promise he desired me to know was given perfectly in complaisance
to me, in whom he had an <normalised orig="intire" auto="true">entire</normalised> confidence.  BEHN-E3-H,193.237
