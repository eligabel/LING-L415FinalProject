SOME PASSAGES OF THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JOHN EARL OF ROCHESTER
BURNETROC-E3-H,1.3

<$$heading>

<font> John <normalised orig="Wilmot" auto="true">Walnut</normalised> <$$font> Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> was born
in <font> April, <normalised orig="Anno" auto="true">Annoy</normalised> <normalised orig="Dom" auto="true">Doom</normalised>. <$$font> 1648.  BURNETROC-E3-H,1.5

his father was <font> Henry <$$font> Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font>
, but best known by the Title of the Lord <P_2> <font> <normalised orig="Wilmot" auto="true">Walnut</normalised> <$$font>
, who bore so great a part in all the late Wars, that mention is often
made of him in the History: And had the chief share in the Honour of
the preservation of His Majesty that now Reigns, after <font> Worcester
<$$font> <normalised orig="-Fight" auto="true">fight</normalised>, and the Conveying Him from Place to Place, till he
happily escaped into <font> France <$$font>: BURNETROC-E3-H,2.6

But dying before the King's Return, he left his Son little other
Inheritance, but the Honour and Title derived to him, with the pretensions
such eminent Services gave him to the King's Favour: BURNETROC-E3-H,2.7

These were carefully managed by the great prudence and discretion of
his Mother, a Daughter of that Noble and ancient Family of the <font>
St. Johns <$$font> of <font> Wiltshire <$$font>, so that his
Education was <P_3> carried on all things <normalised orig="sutably" auto="true">suitably</normalised> to his Quality.
BURNETROC-E3-H,3.8

When he was at School he was an extraordinary Proficient at his Book:
BURNETROC-E3-H,3.9

and those shining parts, which have since appeared with so much lustre;
began then to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> themselves: BURNETROC-E3-H,3.10

He acquired the <font> Latin <$$font> to such perfection, that to his
dying-day he retained a great <normalised orig="rellish" auto="true">relish</normalised> of the fineness and Beauty of
that Tongue: and was exactly versed in the incomparable Authors that
writ about <font> <normalised orig="Augustus's" auto="true">August's</normalised> <$$font> time, whom he read often with that
peculiar delight which the greatest Wits have ever found in those Studies.
BURNETROC-E3-H,3.11

When he went to the <font> University <$$font> the general Joy which
over-ran the whole Nation upon his Majesties <font> <normalised orig="Restauration" auto="true">Restoration</normalised> <$$font>
, <P_4> but was not regulated with that Sobriety and Temperance, that
became a serious gratitude to God for so great a Blessing, produced some
of its ill effects on him: BURNETROC-E3-H,4.12

He began to love these disorders too much; BURNETROC-E3-H,4.13

His Tutor was that Eminent and Pious Divine Dr. <font> Blandford
<$$font>, afterwards promoted to the Sees of <font> Oxford <$$font>
and <font> Worcester <$$font>: BURNETROC-E3-H,4.14

And under his Inspection, he was committed to the more immediate
care of Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Phineas" auto="true">Phone's</normalised> Berry <$$font>, a Fellow of <font>
<normalised orig="Wadham" auto="true">Within</normalised> <$$font> <normalised orig="-Colledge" auto="true">college</normalised>, a very learned and good natured man; whom
he afterwards ever used with much respect, and rewarded him as became
a great man.  BURNETROC-E3-H,4.15

But the humour of that time wrought so much on him, that he broke off the
Course of his Studies; to which no means <P_5> could ever effectually
recall him; till when he was in <font> Italy <$$font> his Governor,
Dr. <font> <normalised orig="Balfour" auto="true">Belabour</normalised> <$$font>, a learned and worthy man, now a
Celebrated <normalised orig="Physitian" auto="true">Physician</normalised> in <font> Scotland <$$font>, his Native Country;
drew him to read such Books, as were most likely to bring him back to
love Learning and Study: BURNETROC-E3-H,5.16

and he often acknowledged to me, in particular three days before his
Death, how much he was obliged to Love and Honour this his <normalised orig="Governour" auto="true">Governor</normalised>,
to whom he thought he owed more than {he_owed_to} to all the World,
next after his Parents, for his great Fidelity and Care of him, while
he was under his trust.  BURNETROC-E3-H,5.17

But no part of it affected him more sensibly, than {it_affected_him} that
he engaged him by many tricks <paren> so he expressed it <$$paren> to
delight in <P_6> Books and reading; So that ever after he took occasion
in the Intervals of those <normalised orig="woful" auto="true">woeful</normalised> <normalised orig="Extravagancies" auto="true">Extravagances</normalised> that consumed most of
his time to read much: BURNETROC-E3-H,6.18

and though the time was generally but indifferently employed, for the
choice of the Subjects of his Studies was not always good, yet the
habitual Love of Knowledge together with these fits of study, had much
awakened his Understanding, BURNETROC-E3-H,6.19

and prepared him for better things, when his mind should be so far
changed as to <normalised orig="rellish" auto="true">relish</normalised> them.  BURNETROC-E3-H,6.20

He came from his Travels in the 18th Year of his {HELSINKI:his_his}
Age, BURNETROC-E3-H,6.21

and appeared at Court with as great Advantages as most ever had.
BURNETROC-E3-H,6.22

He was a Graceful and well shaped Person, tall and well <P_7> made,
if not a little too slender: BURNETROC-E3-H,7.23

He was exactly well bred, BURNETROC-E3-H,7.24

and what by a modest behaviour natural to him, what by a Civility
become almost as natural, his Conversation was <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> and obliging.
BURNETROC-E3-H,7.25

He had a strange Vivacity of thought, and vigour of expression:
BURNETROC-E3-H,7.26

His Wit had a <normalised orig="subtility" auto="true">subtlety</normalised> and sublimity both, that were scarce <normalised orig="imitable" auto="true">immutable</normalised>.
BURNETROC-E3-H,7.27

His Style was clear and strong: BURNETROC-E3-H,7.28

When he used Figures they were very lively, and yet far enough out of
the Common Road: BURNETROC-E3-H,7.29

he had made himself Master of the Ancient and Modern Wit, and of the
Modern <font> French <$$font> and <font> Italian <$$font> as well as
the <font> English <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,7.30

He loved to talk and write of Speculative Matters, BURNETROC-E3-H,7.31

and did it with so fine a thread, that even those who hated the Subjects
<P_8> that his Fancy ran upon, yet could not but be charmed with his
way of treating them.  BURNETROC-E3-H,8.32

<font> <normalised orig="Boileau" auto="true">Bailey</normalised> <$$font> among the <font> French <$$font>, and <font>
<normalised orig="Cowley" auto="true">Coolly</normalised> <$$font> among the <font> English <$$font> Wits, were those he
admired most.  BURNETROC-E3-H,8.33

Sometimes other <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> thoughts mixed with his <normalised orig="Composures" auto="true">Composure's</normalised>,
BURNETROC-E3-H,8.34

but that flowed rather from the Impressions they made on him when he
read them, by which they came to return upon him as his own thoughts
; than {it_flowed_from_the_fact} that he servilely copied from any.
BURNETROC-E3-H,8.35

For few men ever had a bolder flight of fancy, more <normalised orig="steddily" auto="true">steadily</normalised> governed
by Judgment than he had.  BURNETROC-E3-H,8.36

No wonder a young man so made, and so improved was very acceptable in
a Court.  BURNETROC-E3-H,8.37

Soon after his coming thither he laid hold on the first Occasion that
offered to <normalised orig="shew" auto="true">show</normalised> his readiness <P_9> to hazard his life in the Defence
and Service of his Country.  BURNETROC-E3-H,9.38

In <font> Winter <$$font> 1665.  he went with the Earl of <font>
Sandwich <$$font> to Sea, when he was sent to lie for the <font> Dutch
East-India Fleet <$$font>; and was in the <font> Revenge <$$font>,
Commanded by Sir <font> Thomas <normalised orig="Tiddiman" auto="true">Titanium</normalised> <$$font>, when the Attack was
made on the Port of <font> <normalised orig="Bergen" auto="true">Burgeon</normalised> <$$font> in <font> Norway <$$font> ,
the <font> Dutch <$$font> ships having got into that <font> Port <$$font>.
BURNETROC-E3-H,9.39

It was as desperate an Attempt as ever was made: BURNETROC-E3-H,9.40

during the whole Action, the Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> <normalised orig="shewed" auto="true">showed</normalised>
as brave and as resolute a Courage as was possible: BURNETROC-E3-H,9.41

a Person of Honour told me he heard the Lord <font> Clifford <$$font>, who
was in the same Ship, often <normalised orig="magnifie" auto="true">magnify</normalised> his Courage at that time very highly.
BURNETROC-E3-H,9.42

Nor did the Rigours of the Season, the <P_10> hardness of the Voyage,
and the <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised> danger he had been in, deter him from running the like
on the very next Occasion; BURNETROC-E3-H,10.43

For the <font> Summer <$$font> following he went to Sea again, without
communicating his design to his nearest Relations.  BURNETROC-E3-H,10.44

He went aboard the Ship Commanded by Sir <font> Edward <normalised orig="Spragge" auto="true">Sprig</normalised> <$$font>
the day before the great Sea-fight of that Year: BURNETROC-E3-H,10.45

Almost all the Volunteers that were in the same Ship were killed.
BURNETROC-E3-H,10.46

Mr. <font> Middleton <$$font> <paren> brother to Sir <font> Hugh
Middleton <$$font> <$$paren> was shot in his Arms.  BURNETROC-E3-H,10.47

During the Action, Sir <font> Edward <normalised orig="Spragge" auto="true">Sprig</normalised> <$$font>, not being
satisfied with the behaviour of one of the Captains, could not easily
find a Person that would <normalised orig="chearfully" auto="true">cheerfully</normalised> venture through so much danger,
to carry his Commands to that <P_11> Captain.  BURNETROC-E3-H,11.48

This Lord offered himself to the Service; BURNETROC-E3-H,11.49

and went in a little Boat, through all the shot, BURNETROC-E3-H,11.50

and delivered his Message, BURNETROC-E3-H,11.51

and returned back to Sir <font> Edward <$$font>: which was much commended
by all that saw it.  BURNETROC-E3-H,11.52

He thought it necessary to begin his life with these Demonstrations of
his Courage in an Element and way of fighting, which is acknowledged to
be the greatest trial of clear and undaunted Valour.  BURNETROC-E3-H,11.53

He had so entirely laid down the Intemperance that was growing on
him before his Travels, that at his Return he hated nothing more.
BURNETROC-E3-H,11.54

But falling into Company that loved these Excesses, he was, though not
without difficulty, and by many steps, brought back to it <P_12> again.
BURNETROC-E3-H,12.55

And the natural heat of his fancy, being inflamed by Wine, made him so
extravagantly pleasant, that many to be more diverted by that <normalised orig="humor" auto="true">humour</normalised> ,
studied to engage him deeper and deeper in Intemperance: which at length
did so entirely subdue him; that, as he told me, for five years together
he was continually Drunk: BURNETROC-E3-H,12.56

not all the while under the visible effect of it, BURNETROC-E3-H,12.57

but his blood was so inflamed, that he was not in all that time cool
enough to be perfectly Master of himself.  BURNETROC-E3-H,12.58

This led him to say and do many wild and unaccountable things:
BURNETROC-E3-H,12.59

By this, he said, he had broke the firm constitution of his Health, that
seemed so strong, that nothing was too hard for it; BURNETROC-E3-H,12.60

and he had suffered <P_13> so much in his Reputation, that he almost
<normalised orig="dispaired" auto="true">despaired</normalised> to recover it.  BURNETROC-E3-H,13.61

There were two Principles in his natural temper, that being <normalised orig="heighten'd" auto="true">heightened</normalised>
by that heat carried him to great excesses: a violent love of Pleasure,
and a disposition to extravagant Mirth.  BURNETROC-E3-H,13.62

The one involved him in great sensuality: BURNETROC-E3-H,13.63

the other led him to many odd Adventures and <normalised orig="Frollicks" auto="true">Frolics</normalised>, in which he was
oft in hazard of his life.  The one being the same irregular appetite in
his Mind, that the other was in his Body, which made him think nothing
diverting that was not extravagant.  BURNETROC-E3-H,13.64

And though in cold blood he was a generous and good natured man, yet he
would go far in his heats, after any thing that might turn to a Jest or
matter <P_14> of Diversion: BURNETROC-E3-H,14.65

He said to me, He never improved his Interest at Court, to do a
premeditate Mischief to other persons.  BURNETROC-E3-H,14.66

Yet he laid out his Wit very freely in <font> Libels <$$font> and <font>
Satyrs <$$font>, in which he had a peculiar Talent of mixing his Wit
with his Malice, and fitting both with such apt words, that Men were
tempted to be pleased with them: BURNETROC-E3-H,14.67

from thence his <normalised orig="Composures" auto="true">Composure's</normalised> came to be easily known, BURNETROC-E3-H,14.68

for few had such a way of tempering these together as he had; So that
when any thing extraordinary that way came out, as a Child is fathered
sometimes by its Resemblance, so was it laid at his Door as its Parent
and Author.  BURNETROC-E3-H,14.69

These Exercises in the course of his life were not always <P_15> equally
pleasant to him; BURNETROC-E3-H,15.70

he had often sad Intervals and severe Reflections on them:
BURNETROC-E3-H,15.71

and though then he had not these awakened in him from any deep Principle
of Religion, yet the <normalised orig="horrour" auto="true">horror</normalised> that Nature raised in him, especially in
some Sicknesses, made him too <normalised orig="easie" auto="true">easy</normalised> to receive some ill Principles,
which others endeavoured to possess him with; so that he was too soon
brought to set himself to secure, and <normalised orig="fortifie" auto="true">fortify</normalised> his Mind against that , by
dispossessing it all he could of the belief or apprehensions of Religion.
BURNETROC-E3-H,15.72

The Licentiousness of his temper, with the briskness of his Wit, disposed
him to love the Conversation of those who divided their time between
lewd Actions and irregular <P_16> Mirth.  BURNETROC-E3-H,16.73

And so he came to bend his Wit, and direct his Studies and Endeavours
to support and strengthen these ill Principles in himself and others.
BURNETROC-E3-H,16.74

An accident fell out after this, which confirmed him more in these
Courses: BURNETROC-E3-H,16.75

when he went to Sea in the Year 1665, there happened to be in the same
Ship with him Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Mountague" auto="true">Montage</normalised> <$$font> and another Gentleman
of Quality, BURNETROC-E3-H,16.76

these two, the former especially, seemed <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> that they should
never return into <font> England <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,16.77

Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Mountague" auto="true">Montage</normalised> <$$font> said, He was sure of it:
BURNETROC-E3-H,16.78

the other was not so positive.  BURNETROC-E3-H,16.79

The Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font>, and the last of these, <normalised orig="entred" auto="true">entered</normalised> into
a formal Engagement, not without Ceremonies of Religion, that if <P_17>
either of them died, he should appear, and give the other notice of the
future State, if there was any.  BURNETROC-E3-H,17.80

But Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Mountague" auto="true">Montage</normalised> <$$font> would not enter into the Bond.
BURNETROC-E3-H,17.81

When the day came that they thought to have taken the <font> Dutch
<$$font> <normalised orig="-Fleet" auto="true">fleet</normalised> in the Port of <font> <normalised orig="Bergen" auto="true">Burgeon</normalised> <$$font>, Mr. <font>
<normalised orig="Mountague" auto="true">Montage</normalised> <$$font> though he had such a strong Presage in his Mind of
his approaching death, yet he generously staid all the while in the
place of greatest danger: BURNETROC-E3-H,17.82

The other Gentleman <normalised orig="signalized" auto="true">signalised</normalised> his Courage in a most undaunted manner,
till near the end of the Action; when he fell on a sudden into such a
trembling that he could scarce stand; BURNETROC-E3-H,17.83

and Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Mountague" auto="true">Montage</normalised> <$$font> going to him to hold him up , as
they were in each others Arms, a Cannon <P_18> Ball killed him outright,
BURNETROC-E3-H,18.84

and carried away Mr. <font> <normalised orig="Mountague's" auto="true">Montage's</normalised> <$$font> Belly, so that
he died within an hour after.  BURNETROC-E3-H,18.85

The Earl of <font> Rochester <$$font> told me that these Presages they
had in their minds made some impression on him, that there were separated
Beings: and that the Soul, either by a natural sagacity, or some secret
Notice communicated to it, had a sort of Divination: BURNETROC-E3-H,18.86

But that <normalised orig="Gentlemans" auto="true">Gentleman's</normalised> never appearing was a great snare to him, during
the rest of his life.  Though when he told me this, he could not but
acknowledge, it was as unreasonable thing for him, to think, that Beings
in another State were not under such Laws and Limits, that they could
not command their own motions, <P_19> but as the <normalised orig="Supream" auto="true">Supreme</normalised> Power should
order them: and that one who had so corrupted the Natural Principles
of Truth, as he had, had no reason to expect that such an extraordinary
thing should be done for his Conviction.  BURNETROC-E3-H,19.87

He told me of another odd Presage that one had of his approaching
Death in the Lady <font> <normalised orig="Warre" auto="true">War</normalised> <$$font>, his Mother in Laws house:
BURNETROC-E3-H,19.88

The Chaplain had <normalised orig="dream't" auto="true">dreamed</normalised> that such a day he should die,
BURNETROC-E3-H,19.89

but being by all the Family put out of the belief of it, he had almost
forgot it; till the Evening before at Supper, there being Thirteen at
Table; according to a fond conceit that one of these must soon die,
One of the young Ladies pointed to him, that he was to <P_20> die.
BURNETROC-E3-H,20.90

He remembering his Dream fell into some disorder BURNETROC-E3-H,20.91

and the Lady <font> <normalised orig="Warre" auto="true">War</normalised> <$$font> reproving him for his Superstition , he
said, He was confident he was to die before Morning, BURNETROC-E3-H,20.92

but he being in perfect health, it was not much minded.
BURNETROC-E3-H,20.93

It was <font> Saturday <$$font> <normalised orig="-Night" auto="true">night</normalised>, BURNETROC-E3-H,20.94

and he was to Preach next day.  BURNETROC-E3-H,20.95

He went to his Chamber BURNETROC-E3-H,20.96

and sate up late, as appeared by the burning of his Candle,
BURNETROC-E3-H,20.97

and he had been preparing his Notes for his Sermon, BURNETROC-E3-H,20.98

but was found dead in his Bed the next Morning: BURNETROC-E3-H,20.99

These things he said made him inclined to believe, the Soul was a
substance distinct from matter: BURNETROC-E3-H,20.100

and this often returned into his thoughts.  BURNETROC-E3-H,20.101

But that which perfected his <normalised orig="perswasion" auto="true">persuasion</normalised> about it, was, that in the
Sickness <P_21> which brought him so near death before I first knew him,
when his Spirits were so low and spent, that he could not move nor stir,
and he did not think to live an hour; He said, His Reason and Judgment
were so clear and strong, that from thence he was fully <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> that
Death was not the spending or dissolution of the Soul; but only the
separation of it from matter.  BURNETROC-E3-H,21.102

He had in that Sickness great <normalised orig="Remorses" auto="true">Remorse's</normalised> for his past Life,
BURNETROC-E3-H,21.103

but he afterwards told me, They were rather general and dark <normalised orig="Horrours" auto="true">Horrors</normalised>,
than any Convictions of sinning against God.  BURNETROC-E3-H,21.104

He was sorry he had lived so as to <normalised orig="wast" auto="true">waste</normalised> his strength so soon, or that
he had brought such an ill name upon himself, BURNETROC-E3-H,21.105

and had an Agony in <P_22> his Mind about it, which he knew not well
how to express: BURNETROC-E3-H,22.106

But at such times, though he complied with his Friends in suffering
Divines to be sent for, he said, He had no great mind to it: and that
it was but a piece of his breeding, to desire them to pray by him,
in which he <normalised orig="joyned" auto="true">joined</normalised> little himself.  BURNETROC-E3-H,22.107

As to the <normalised orig="Supream" auto="true">Supreme</normalised> Being, he had always some Impression of one:
BURNETROC-E3-H,22.108

and professed often to me, That he had never known an entire
<font> Atheist <$$font>, who fully believed there was no God.
BURNETROC-E3-H,22.109

Yet when he explained his Notion of this Being, it amounted to no more
than a vast power, that had none of the Attributes of Goodness or Justice,
we ascribe to the Deity: BURNETROC-E3-H,22.110

These were his thoughts about Religion, <P_23> as himself told me.
BURNETROC-E3-H,23.111

For Morality, he freely <normalised orig="own'd" auto="true">owned</normalised> to me, that though he talked of it,
as a fine thing, yet this was only because he thought it a decent way
of speaking, and that as they went always in <normalised orig="Cloaths" auto="true">Clothes</normalised>, though in their
<normalised orig="Frollicks" auto="true">Frolics</normalised> they would have chosen sometimes to have gone naked, if they
had not feared the people: So though some of them found it necessary for
humane life to talk of Morality, yet he confessed they cared not for
it, further than the reputation of it was necessary for their credit,
and affairs: of which he gave me many Instances, as their professing
and swearing Friendship, where they hated mortally; their Oaths and
Imprecations in their Addresses to Women, <P_24> which they intended
never to make good; the pleasure they took in defaming innocent Persons,
and spreading false Reports of some, perhaps in Revenge, because they
could not <normalised orig="enage" auto="true">image</normalised> {COM:sic} them to comply with their ill Designs: The
delight they had in making people quarrel; their unjust usage of their
Creditors, and putting them off by any deceitful Promise they could
invent, that might deliver them from present Importunity.  So that in
detestation of these Courses he would often break forth into such hard
Expressions concerning himself as would be indecent for another to repeat.
BURNETROC-E3-H,24.112

Such had been his Principles and Practices in a Course of many years
which had almost <P_25> quite <normalised orig="extinguish't" auto="true">extinguished</normalised> the natural Propensities in
him to Justice and <normalised orig="Vertue" auto="true">Virtue</normalised>: BURNETROC-E3-H,25.113

He would often go into the Country, and be for some months wholly <normalised orig="imployed" auto="true">employed</normalised>
in Study, or the Sallies of his Wit: Which he came to direct chiefly to
<font> <normalised orig="Satyre" auto="true">Satire</normalised> <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,25.114

And this he often defended to me; by saying there were some people
that could not be kept in Order, or admonished but in this way.
BURNETROC-E3-H,25.115

I replied, That it might be granted that a grave way of <font>
<normalised orig="Satyre" auto="true">Satire</normalised> <$$font> was sometimes no <normalised orig="improfitable" auto="true">unprofitable</normalised> way of Reproof.
BURNETROC-E3-H,25.116

and Yet they who used it only out of spite, and mixed <normalised orig="Lyes" auto="true">Lies</normalised> with Truth,
sparing nothing that might adorn their <font> Poems <$$font>, or <normalised orig="gratifie" auto="true">gratify</normalised>
their Revenge, could not excuse that way of Reproach, by which <P_26>
the Innocent often suffer: since the most malicious things, if wittily
expressed, might stick to and blemish the best men in the World, and the
malice of a Libel could hardly consist with the Charity of an Admonition.
BURNETROC-E3-H,26.117

To this he answered, A man could not write with life, unless he were
heated by Revenge: BURNETROC-E3-H,26.118

For to make a <font> <normalised orig="Satyre" auto="true">Satire</normalised> <$$font> without Resentments, upon the cold
Notions of <font> <normalised orig="Phylosophy" auto="true">Philosophy</normalised> <$$font>, was as if a man would in cold
blood, cut <normalised orig="mens" auto="true">men's</normalised> throats who had never offended him: BURNETROC-E3-H,26.119

And he said, The <normalised orig="Lyes" auto="true">Lies</normalised> in these Libels came <normalised orig="ofen" auto="true">open</normalised> in as Ornaments that could
not be spared without spoiling the beauty of the <font> Poem <$$font>.
BURNETROC-E3-H,26.120

For his other Studies, they were divided between the Comical <P_27> and
witty Writings of the Ancients and Moderns, the <font> Roman <$$font>
Authors, and Books of <normalised orig="Physick" auto="true">Physic</normalised>: which the ill state of health he was
fallen into, made more necessary to himself: and which <normalised orig="qualifi'd" auto="true">qualified</normalised> him for
an odd adventure, which I shall but just mention.  BURNETROC-E3-H,27.121

Being under an unlucky Accident, which obliged him to keep out of the
way; He disguised himself, so that his nearest Friends could not have
known him, BURNETROC-E3-H,27.122

and set up in <font> Tower-street <$$font> for an <font> Italian
Mountebank <$$font>, where he practised <normalised orig="Physick" auto="true">Physic</normalised> for some Weeks not
without success.  BURNETROC-E3-H,27.123

In his later years, he read Books of History more.  BURNETROC-E3-H,27.124

He took pleasure to disguise himself as a <font> Porter <$$font>, or as
a <font> Beggar <$$font>; sometimes to follow <P_28> some mean Amours,
which, for the variety of them, he affected; BURNETROC-E3-H,28.125

At other times, <normalised orig="meerly" auto="true">merely</normalised> for diversion, he would go about in odd shapes,
in which he acted his part so naturally, that even those who were in the
secret, and saw him in these shapes, could perceive nothing by which he
might be discovered.  BURNETROC-E3-H,28.126

<P_136>

He told me when I saw him, That he hoped I would come to him upon that
general Insinuation of the desire he had of my Company; and he was <normalised orig="loth" auto="true">loath</normalised> to
write more plainly: not knowing whether I could easily spare so much time.
BURNETROC-E3-H,136.128

I told him, That on the other hand, I looked on it as a presumption to
come so far, when he was in such excellent hands; BURNETROC-E3-H,136.129

and though perhaps the freedom formerly between us, might have excused
it with those to whom it was known; yet it might have the appearance
of so much Vanity, to such as were strangers to it; So that till I
received his Letter, I did not think it convenient to come to him:
BURNETROC-E3-H,136.130

And then not hearing that there was any danger of a sudden change, I
<P_137> delayed going to him till the Twentieth of <font> July <$$font>.
BURNETROC-E3-H,137.131

At my coming to his House an accident fell out not worth mentioning,
but that some have made a story of it.  BURNETROC-E3-H,137.132

His Servant, being a <font> French-man <$$font>, carried up my Name
wrong, so that he mistook it for another, who had sent to him, that he
would undertake his Cure, BURNETROC-E3-H,137.133

and he being resolved not to meddle with him, did not care to see him:
BURNETROC-E3-H,137.134

This mistake lasted some hours, with which I was better contented,
because he was not then in such a condition that my being about him
could have been of any use to him: BURNETROC-E3-H,137.135

for that Night was like to have been his last.  BURNETROC-E3-H,137.136

He had a <font> Convulsion-Fit <$$font>, BURNETROC-E3-H,137.137

and raved; BURNETROC-E3-H,137.138

but, <font> Opiates <$$font> being given him, after some hours <P_138>
rest, his raving left him so entirely, that it never again returned
to him.  BURNETROC-E3-H,138.139

I $can $not {TEXT:cannot} easily express the Transport he was in, when
he awoke and saw me by him: BURNETROC-E3-H,138.140

He brake out in the tenderest Expressions concerning my kindness in coming
so far to see <font> such a One <$$font>, using terms of great abhorrence
concerning himself, which I forbear to relate.  BURNETROC-E3-H,138.141

He told me, as his strength served him at several snatches, for he
was then so low, that he could not hold up discourse long at once,
what sense he had of his past life; what sad apprehension for having so
offended his Maker, and dishonoured his Redeemer: What <normalised orig="Horrours" auto="true">Horrors</normalised> he had
gone through, and how much his Mind was turned to <P_139> call on God,
and on his Crucified Saviour: So that he hoped he should obtain Mercy,
BURNETROC-E3-H,139.142

for he believed he had sincerely repented; and had now a calm
in his Mind after that storm that he had been in for some Weeks.
BURNETROC-E3-H,139.143

He had strong Apprehensions and <normalised orig="Perswasions" auto="true">Persuasions</normalised> of his admittance to
Heaven : of which he spake once not without some extraordinary Emotion.
BURNETROC-E3-H,139.144

It was indeed the only time that he spake with any great warmth to me:
BURNETROC-E3-H,139.145

For his Spirits were then low, and so far spent, that though those about
him told me, He had expressed formerly great <normalised orig="fervor" auto="true">fervour</normalised> in his Devotions; Yet
Nature was so much sunk, that these were in a great measure fallen off.
BURNETROC-E3-H,139.146

But he made me pray <P_140> often with him; BURNETROC-E3-H,140.147

and spoke of his Conversion to God as a thing now grown up in him to a
<normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> and calm serenity.  BURNETROC-E3-H,140.148

He was very anxious to $have {TEXT:'have'_missing} known my Opinion of
a Death-Bed Repentance.  BURNETROC-E3-H,140.149

I told him, That before I gave any Resolution in that, it would be
convenient that I should be acquainted more particularly with the
Circumstances and Progress of his Repentance.  BURNETROC-E3-H,140.150

Upon this he satisfied me in many particulars.  BURNETROC-E3-H,140.151

He said, He was now <normalised orig="perswaded" auto="true">persuaded</normalised> both of the truth of <font> Christianity
<$$font>, and of the power of inward Grace, of which he gave me this
strange account.  BURNETROC-E3-H,140.152

He said, Mr. <font> Parsons <$$font> in order to his Conviction,
read to him the 53. <font> Chapter <$$font> of the <normalised orig="Prophesie" auto="true">Prophecy</normalised> of
<P_141> <font> <normalised orig="Isaiah" auto="true">Asia</normalised> <$$font>, BURNETROC-E3-H,141.153

and compared <font> that <$$font> with the History of our Saviour's
Passion, that he might there see a <normalised orig="Prophesie" auto="true">Prophecy</normalised> concerning it, written many
Ages before it was done; which the <font> Jews <$$font> that blasphemed
Jesus Christ still kept in their hands, as a Book divinely inspired.
BURNETROC-E3-H,141.154

He said to me, <font> That as he heard it read, he felt an inward force
upon him, which did so enlighten his Mind, and convince him, that he
could resist it no longer: BURNETROC-E3-H,141.155

For the words had an authority which did shoot like <normalised orig="Raies" auto="true">Rays</normalised> or Beams in his
Mind; So that he was not only convinced by the <normalised orig="Reasonings" auto="true">Reasoning's</normalised> he had about it,
which satisfied his Understanding, but by a power which did so effectually
constrain him, that he did ever after as firmly believe in his Saviour, as
if he had seen <P_142> him in the Clouds <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,142.156

He had made it to be read so often to him, that he had got it by heart :
BURNETROC-E3-H,142.157

and went through a great part of it in Discourse with me, with
a sort of heavenly Pleasure, giving me his Reflections on it.
BURNETROC-E3-H,142.158

Some few I remember, <font> Who hath believed our Report <$$font>?
BURNETROC-E3-H,142.159

<font> Here <$$font>, he said, <font> was foretold the Opposition
the Gospel was to meet with from such Wretches as he was.
BURNETROC-E3-H,142.160

He hath no Form nor <normalised orig="Comliness" auto="true">Comeliness</normalised>, BURNETROC-E3-H,142.161

and when we shall see Him, there is no beauty that we should desire
him <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,142.162

On this he said, <font> The meanness of his appearance and Person has
made vain and foolish people disparage Him, because he came not in such
a Fools-Coat as they delight in <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,142.163

What he said on the other parts I do not well remember:
BURNETROC-E3-H,142.164

and indeed I was so affected with <P_143> what he said then to me,
that the general transport I was under during the whole Discourse, made
me less capable to remember these Particulars, as I wish I had done.
BURNETROC-E3-H,143.165

He told me, That he had thereupon received the Sacrament with great
satisfaction and that was <normalised orig="encreased" auto="true">increased</normalised> by the pleasure he had in his Ladies
receiving it with him: who had been for some years misled into the
Communion of the Church of <font> Rome <$$font>, BURNETROC-E3-H,143.166

and he himself had been not a little Instrumental in procuring it, as
he freely acknowledged.  So that it was one of the joyfullest things
that <normalised orig="befel" auto="true">befell</normalised> him in his Sickness, that he had seen that Mischief removed,
in which he had so great a Hand: BURNETROC-E3-H,143.167

and <P_144> during his whole Sickness, he expressed so much tenderness
and true kindness to his Lady, that as it easily defaced the remembrance
of every thing wherein he had been in fault formerly, so it drew from
her the most passionate care and concern for him that was possible:
which indeed deserves a higher Character than is decent to give of a
Person yet alive.  BURNETROC-E3-H,144.168

But I shall confine my Discourse to the Dead.  BURNETROC-E3-H,144.169

He told me, He had overcome all his Resentments to all the World; So
that he bore ill will to no Person, nor hated any upon personal accounts.
BURNETROC-E3-H,144.170

He had given a true state of his Debts, BURNETROC-E3-H,144.171

and had ordered to pay them all, as far as his Estate that was not <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised>,
could go: BURNETROC-E3-H,144.172

<P_145>

and was confident that if all that was owing to him were paid to his
Executors, his Creditors would be all satisfied.  BURNETROC-E3-H,145.174

He said, He found his Mind now possessed with another sense of things
than ever he had formerly: BURNETROC-E3-H,145.175

He did not <normalised orig="repine" auto="true">rapine</normalised> under all his pain, BURNETROC-E3-H,145.176

and in one of the sharpest Fits he was under while I was with him;
He said, <font> He did willingly submit <$$font>; BURNETROC-E3-H,145.177

and looking up to Heaven, said, <font> God's holy Will be done,
BURNETROC-E3-H,145.178

I bless Him for all He does to me <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,145.179

He professed he was contented either to die or live, as should please
God: BURNETROC-E3-H,145.180

And though it was a foolish thing for a man to pretend to choose , Whether
he would die or live, yet he wished rather to die.  BURNETROC-E3-H,145.181

He knew he could never be so well, that life should be <P_146> comfortable
to him.  BURNETROC-E3-H,146.182

He was confident he should be happy if he died BURNETROC-E3-H,146.183

but he feared if he lived he might Relapse: BURNETROC-E3-H,146.184

And then said he to me, <font> In what a condition shall I be, if I
Relapse after all this?  BURNETROC-E3-H,146.185

But <$$font>, he said, <font> he trusted in the Grace and Goodness of God,
and was resolved to avoid all those Temptations, that Course of Life,
and Company, that was likely to <normalised orig="insnare" auto="true">ensnare</normalised> him: BURNETROC-E3-H,146.186

and he desired to live on no other account, but that he might by the
change of his Manners some way take off the high Scandal his former
Behaviour had given <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,146.187

All these things at several times I had from him, besides some Messages
which very well became a dying Penitent to some of his former Friends, and
a Charge to publish any thing <P_147> concerning him, that might be a mean
to reclaim others.  <font> Praying God, that as his life had done much
hurt, so his death might do some good.  <$$font> BURNETROC-E3-H,147.188

Having understood all these things from him, and being pressed to give
him my Opinion plainly about his Eternal State; I told him, That though
the Promises of the Gospel did all depend upon a real change of Heart and
Life, as the indispensable condition upon which they were made; and that
it was scarce possible to know certainly whether our Hearts are changed,
unless it appeared in our lives; and the Repentance of most dying men,
being like the <normalised orig="howlings" auto="true">howling</normalised> of condemned Prisoners for Pardon, which flowed
from no sense of their <P_148> Crimes, but from the <normalised orig="horrour" auto="true">horror</normalised> of approaching
Death; there was little reason to encourage any to hope much from such
Sorrowing: Yet certainly if the Mind of a Sinner, even on a Death-Bed,
be truly renewed and turned to God, so great is His Mercy, that He will
receive him, even in that extremity.  BURNETROC-E3-H,148.189

He said, <font> He was sure his Mind was entirely turned and though
<normalised orig="Horrour" auto="true">Horror</normalised> had given him his first awaking, yet that was now grown up into
a <normalised orig="setled" auto="true">settled</normalised> Faith and Conversion <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,148.190

There is but one prejudice lies against all this, to defeat the good
Ends of Divine Providence by it upon others, as well as on himself:
BURNETROC-E3-H,148.191

and that is that it was a part of his Disease, and that the lowness of
<P_149> his Spirits made such an alteration in him, that he was not what
he had formerly been: BURNETROC-E3-H,149.192

and this some have carried so far as to say, That he died mad:
BURNETROC-E3-H,149.193

These Reports are raised by those who are unwilling that the last Thoughts
or Words of a Person, every way so extraordinary, should have any effect
either on themselves or others: BURNETROC-E3-H,149.194

And it is to be <normalised orig="fear'd" auto="true">feared</normalised>, that some may have so far feared their
Consciences, and exceeded the common Measures of Sin and Infidelity ,
that neither this Testimony, nor one coming from the Dead, would <normalised orig="signifie" auto="true">signify</normalised>
much towards their Conviction.  BURNETROC-E3-H,149.195

That this Lord was either mad or stupid, is a thing so notoriously untrue
, that it is the greatest Impudence <P_150> for any that were about him,
to Report it; and a very unreasonable Credulity in others to believe it.
BURNETROC-E3-H,150.196

All the while I was with him, after he had slept out the disorders of
the Fit he was in the first Night, he was not only without Ravings;
BURNETROC-E3-H,150.197

but had a clearness in his Thoughts, in his Memory, in his reflections
on Things and Persons, far beyond what I ever saw in a Person so low in
his strength.  BURNETROC-E3-H,150.198

He was not able to hold out long in Discourse, BURNETROC-E3-H,150.199

for his Spirits failed: BURNETROC-E3-H,150.200

but once for half an hour, and often for a quarter of an hour, after
he awakened, he had a Vivacity in his Discourse that was extraordinary,
and in all things like himself.  BURNETROC-E3-H,150.201

He called often for his Children, his Son the now Earl of <font> Rochester
<$$font>, <P_151> and his three Daughters, BURNETROC-E3-H,151.202

and spake to them with a sense and feeling that $can $not {TEXT:cannot}
be expressed in Writing.  BURNETROC-E3-H,151.203

He called me once to look on them all, BURNETROC-E3-H,151.204

and said, <font> See how Good God has been to me, in giving me so many
Blessings, BURNETROC-E3-H,151.205

and I have carried my self to Him like an ungracious and <normalised orig="unthankful" auto="true">unthinkable</normalised>
Dog <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,151.206

He once talked a great deal to me of <normalised orig="Publick" auto="true">Public</normalised> Affairs, and of many
Persons and things, with the same clearness of thought and expression
, that {with} he had ever done before.  So that by no sign, but his
Weakness of Body, and giving over Discourse so soon, could I perceive a
difference between what his Parts formerly were, and what they were then.
BURNETROC-E3-H,151.207

And that wherein the presence of his Mind appeared <P_152> most, was in
the total change of an ill habit grown so much upon him, that he could
hardly govern himself, when he was any ways heated, three Minutes without
falling into it; BURNETROC-E3-H,152.208

I mean <font> Swearing <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,152.209

He had acknowledged to me the former Winter, that he abhorred it as
a base and indecent thing, and had set himself much to break it off:
BURNETROC-E3-H,152.210

but he confessed that he was so <normalised orig="over-power'd" auto="true">over-powered</normalised> by that ill Custom,
that he could not speak with any warmth, without repeated Oaths,
which, upon any sort of provocation, came almost naturally from him:
BURNETROC-E3-H,152.211

But in his last <normalised orig="Remorses" auto="true">Remorse's</normalised> this did so sensibly affect him, that by
a resolute and constant watchfulness, the habit of it was perfectly
<normalised orig="master'd" auto="true">mastered</normalised>; So that, <P_153> upon the returns of pain which were very
severe and frequent upon him, the last day I was with him; or upon such
<normalised orig="Displeasures" auto="true">Displeasure's</normalised> as people sick or in pain are apt to take of a sudden at
those about them; On all these Occasions he never swore an Oath all the
while I was there.  BURNETROC-E3-H,153.212

Once he was offended with the delay of one that he thought made not <normalised orig="hast" auto="true">haste</normalised>
enough, with somewhat he called for, BURNETROC-E3-H,153.213

and said in a little heat, <font> That damned Fellow <$$font>:
BURNETROC-E3-H,153.214

Soon after I told him, I was glad to find his Style so reformed,
and that he had so entirely overcome that ill habit of Swearing;
BURNETROC-E3-H,153.215

Only that word of calling any <font> damned <$$font>, which had returned
upon him, was not decent.  BURNETROC-E3-H,153.216

His Answer <P_154> was: <font> Oh that Language of Fiends, which was so
familiar to me, hangs yet about me: BURNETROC-E3-H,154.217

Sure none has deserved more to be damned than I have done <$$font>.
BURNETROC-E3-H,154.218

And after he had humbly asked God Pardon for it, he desired me to call the
Person to him, that he might ask him forgiveness: BURNETROC-E3-H,154.219

but I told him that was needless BURNETROC-E3-H,154.220

for he had said it of one that did not hear it, and so could not be
offended by it.  BURNETROC-E3-H,154.221

In this disposition of Mind did he continue all the while I was with him,
four days together; BURNETROC-E3-H,154.222

He was then brought so low that all hope of Recovery was gone.
BURNETROC-E3-H,154.223

Much purulent matter came from him with his Urine, which he passed
always with some pain; But one day with <normalised orig="unexpressible" auto="true">inexpressible</normalised> torment:
BURNETROC-E3-H,154.224

<P_155>

Yet he bore it decently, without breaking out into <normalised orig="Repinings" auto="true">Repining</normalised>, or impatient
Complaints.  BURNETROC-E3-H,155.226

He imagined he had a Stone in his Passage, BURNETROC-E3-H,155.227

but it being searched, none was found.  BURNETROC-E3-H,155.228

The whole substance of his Body was drained by the Ulcer,
BURNETROC-E3-H,155.229

and nothing was left but Skin and Bone: BURNETROC-E3-H,155.230

and by lying much on his Back, the parts there began to <normalised orig="mortifie" auto="true">mortify</normalised>.
BURNETROC-E3-H,155.231

But he had been formerly so low, that he seemed as much past all hopes
of life as now; which made him one Morning after a full and sweet Nights
rest, procured by Laudanum, given him without his knowledge, to fancy
it was an effort of Nature, and to begin to entertain some hopes of
Recovery: BURNETROC-E3-H,155.232

For he said, He felt himself perfectly well, and that he <P_156> had
nothing ailing him, but an <normalised orig="extream" auto="true">extreme</normalised> weakness, which might go off in time:
BURNETROC-E3-H,156.233

and then he entertained me with the Scheme he had laid down for the rest
of his life, how retired, how strict, and how studious he intended to
be: BURNETROC-E3-H,156.234

But this was soon over, BURNETROC-E3-H,156.235

for he quickly felt that it was only the effect of a good sleep, and
that he was still in a very desperate state.  BURNETROC-E3-H,156.236

I thought to have left him on <font> Friday <$$font>,
BURNETROC-E3-H,156.237

but not without some Passion, he desired me to stay that day:
BURNETROC-E3-H,156.238

there appeared no <normalised orig="symptome" auto="true">symptom</normalised> of present death; BURNETROC-E3-H,156.239

and a Worthy <normalised orig="Physitian" auto="true">Physician</normalised> then with him, told me, That though he was so low
that an accident might carry him away on a <normalised orig="suddain" auto="true">sudden</normalised>; Yet without that,
he thought he might live yet <P_157> some Weeks.  BURNETROC-E3-H,157.240

So on <font> Saturday <$$font>, at Four of the Clock in the Morning I
left him, being the 24th of <font> July <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,157.241

But I <normalised orig="durst" auto="true">dared</normalised> not take leave of him; BURNETROC-E3-H,157.242

for he had expressed so great an unwillingness to part with me the day
before, that if I had not presently yielded to one days stay, it was
like to have given him some trouble, BURNETROC-E3-H,157.243

therefore I thought it better to leave him without any Formality.
BURNETROC-E3-H,157.244

Some hours after he asked for me, BURNETROC-E3-H,157.245

and when it was told him, I was gone, he <normalised orig="seem'd" auto="true">seemed</normalised> to be troubled,
BURNETROC-E3-H,157.246

and said, <font> Has my friend left me, BURNETROC-E3-H,157.247

then I shall die shortly <$$font>.  BURNETROC-E3-H,157.248

After that he spake but once or twice till he died: BURNETROC-E3-H,157.249

He lay much silent: BURNETROC-E3-H,157.250

Once they heard him praying very devoutly.  BURNETROC-E3-H,157.251

<P_158>

And on <font> Monday <$$font> about Two of the Clock in the Morning,
he died, without any <font> Convulsion <$$font>, or so much as a groan.
BURNETROC-E3-H,158.253
