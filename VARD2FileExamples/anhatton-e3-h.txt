<normalised orig="Y=e=" auto="true">Yew</normalised> 5=th= of Feb., $1695.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,211.3

The post served me just as it did <normalised orig="y=r=" auto="true">yore</normalised> <normalised orig="Losp" auto="true">Lisp</normalised>. ANHATTON-E3-H,2,211.4

for last night I received both <normalised orig="y=rs=" auto="true">years</normalised> of the 30 of Jan: and that of the
second of this <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised>.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,211.5

<normalised orig="Heneage" auto="true">Henna's</normalised> is so well, he plays about his room, ANHATTON-E3-H,2,211.6

and to morrow is to take <normalised orig="phisick" auto="true">physic</normalised>.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,211.7

I have endeavoured all I can that Essex should have <P_2,212> them;
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.8

and she herself had <normalised orig="tryed" auto="true">tried</normalised> if the small pox is to be <normalised orig="catched" auto="true">catches</normalised>,
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.9

for the second day they were come out of her brother she <normalised orig="gott" auto="true">got</normalised> into his
room ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.10

and kissed him, ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.11

yet hitherto she keeps well.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.12

I do not yet know when I shall leave this $<normalised orig="towne" auto="true">town</normalised> {TEXT:twone}.
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.13

Whenever I do, $<normalised orig="'t" auto="true">to</normalised> $will {TEXT:twill} be <normalised orig="w=th=" auto="true">withe</normalised> less <normalised orig="relucktancy" auto="true">reluctance</normalised> then
{with} ever I did in my life.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.14

There is so slow a progress made in ordering the dismal ceremony of the
Queens funeral, that I $can $n't {TEXT:cant} <normalised orig="ges" auto="true">gas</normalised> when it will be <normalised orig="finishd" auto="true">finished</normalised>.
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.15

I was told this day that the heralds had yet a quarter of their work to
do: ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.16

and I fear, when there work is over, there will come <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> things
<normalised orig="betwixts" auto="true">bedsides</normalised> that and the <normalised orig="Abby" auto="true">Abbey</normalised>.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.17

The King sent yesterday for all the Queens chief officers,
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.18

and, upon seeing of them, fell into a great passion.
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.19

He told them the Queen had recommended all her family to his care
, <normalised orig="w=th=out" auto="true">without</normalised> <normalised orig="w=ch=" auto="true">which</normalised> tho he should not have been <normalised orig="forgetfull" auto="true">forgetful</normalised> of them,
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.20

yet he had now another <normalised orig="tye" auto="true">tie</normalised> upon him to take care of them.
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.21

I <normalised orig="belive" auto="true">believe</normalised> this was part of what he found written in the Queens desk.
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.22

I do not yet hear of <normalised orig="anny" auto="true">any</normalised> other thing mentioned, ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.23

but I suppose this was not all.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.24

I find it begins to be doubted <normalised orig="wether" auto="true">whether</normalised> the Princess be <normalised orig="w=th=" auto="true">withe</normalised> child.
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.25

A little time will resolve it.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.26

The Parliament <normalised orig="setts" auto="true">sets</normalised> very late every day, ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.27

but what they do is so much above my understanding, I $can $n't
{TEXT:cant} pretend to give an account of it; ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.28

so this time will trouble <normalised orig="y=r=" auto="true">yore</normalised> <normalised orig="Losp" auto="true">Lisp</normalised> no more <normalised orig="w=th=" auto="true">withe</normalised> <normalised orig="y=r=" auto="true">yore</normalised> most obedient,
<normalised orig="duttyful" auto="true">dutiful</normalised> daughter, A. Nottingham.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,212.29

My Lord, I fear my Lady found it a wearisome day when she went to <normalised orig="Exton" auto="true">Euston</normalised>,

of teaching.  ANHATTON-E3-H,2,214.36

His price will be three pound a <normalised orig="moneth" auto="true">month</normalised> for each child,
ANHATTON-E3-H,2,214.37

walk and make a <normalised orig="legg" auto="true">leg</normalised>, ANHATTON-E3-H,2,214.38

and expects to have his charges born <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> {BES_ok?} and up <normalised orig="againe" auto="true">again</normalised>.
