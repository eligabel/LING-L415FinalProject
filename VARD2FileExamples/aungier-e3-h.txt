June 5 1675 AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.4

My Lord, The scene being much altered in ye difference between both Houses
since my last, I presume to give <normalised orig="yr" auto="true">ire</normalised> <normalised orig="Ex=cy=" auto="true">Essay</normalised> this short narrative of it.
AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.5

On Tuesday last the House of Commons ordered their Sergeant to take into
<normalised orig="Custodye" auto="true">Custody</normalised> Sir Jo: Churchill, Mr <normalised orig="Serg=t=" auto="true">Serest</normalised> Pemberton, Mr <normalised orig="Serg=t=" auto="true">Serest</normalised> <normalised orig="Pecke" auto="true">Peck</normalised> and Mr
Charles Porter, as persons who had infringed the <normalised orig="Previledges" auto="true">Privileges</normalised> of ye House
by appearing at the Lords'Barre in a case wherein Mr. <normalised orig="Dalmahoy" auto="true">Dylan</normalised>
<paren> a member of ye House <$$paren> was concerned.  AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.6

And to the intent that they might be ye easier had, Mr Speaker invited
them to dinner AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.7

and after they had made good <normalised orig="cheere" auto="true">cheer</normalised> gave them very good advice to obviate
and prevent any further disputes between both Houses, <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised> they then
seemed to <normalised orig="complye" auto="true">comply</normalised> withe, AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.8

But our <normalised orig="Serg=t=" auto="true">Serest</normalised> letting them have their liberty upon <normalised orig="parroll" auto="true">parole</normalised> they were
the next day sent for by ye Lords and <normalised orig="att" auto="true">at</normalised> their <normalised orig="barre" auto="true">bar</normalised> interrogated in
all particulars concerning their <normalised orig="committment" auto="true">commitment</normalised>, AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.9

and had thereafter given them the protection of ye House.
AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.10

The same day ye Lords sent a message to us bye my Lord Chief Justice of
the Common Pleas and my Lo: <normalised orig="Chiefe" auto="true">Chief</normalised> Baron for a present Conference upon
matters of high importance wherein his <normalised orig="Ma=ties=" auto="true">Mattes</normalised> honour and ye safety of
ye Kingdom was concerned, AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.11

and the Houses agreeing to ye present Conference the <normalised orig="inclosed" auto="true">enclosed</normalised>
paper was read with a very audible voice by my Lord Privy <normalised orig="Seale" auto="true">Seal</normalised>.
AUNGIER-E3-H,24,P.12

On Thursday the House sent their Sergeant to ye tower for neglect <P_25,P>
of his duty in suffering his prisoners to escape AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.13

and ordered Mr Secretary in their name to beseech his <normalised orig="Ma=tie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> that wee
might have another Sergeant appointed to attend them, AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.14

and accordingly my Lord <normalised orig="Chamberlaine" auto="true">Chamberlain</normalised> <normalised orig="appoynted" auto="true">appointed</normalised> one <normalised orig="Topham" auto="true">Typhoon</normalised> a very stout
fellow to attend ye House.  AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.15

Yesterday morning as Mr Speaker was coming through Westminster Hall to
ye House he <normalised orig="mett" auto="true">met</normalised> Mr <normalised orig="Serg=t=" auto="true">Serest</normalised> Pemberton whom he commanded his officers
then attending to apprehend and secure in ye Speaker's Chamber, of <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised>
he gave ye House an <normalised orig="acc=t=" auto="true">accede</normalised> as <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as they sate, AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.16

and <normalised orig="receaved" auto="true">received</normalised> the thanks of ye House for his <normalised orig="zeale" auto="true">zeal</normalised> and care in thus
asserting their <normalised orig="previledges" auto="true">privileges</normalised>, AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.17

and the House being then <normalised orig="alsoe" auto="true">also</normalised> informed that Sir John Churchill Mr
<normalised orig="Serg=t=" auto="true">Serest</normalised> <normalised orig="Peeke" auto="true">Peek</normalised> and Mr. <normalised orig="Charley" auto="true">Shirley</normalised> Porter were <normalised orig="belowe" auto="true">below</normalised> in ye Hall, they
commanded instantly their <normalised orig="Serg=t=" auto="true">Serest</normalised> to carry his men with him <normalised orig="downe" auto="true">down</normalised> into
ye Hall and to apprehend ye <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> persons though they were pleading at ye
<normalised orig="Barres" auto="true">Bars</normalised> of any of ye <normalised orig="Courtes" auto="true">Courts</normalised>, and to <normalised orig="goe" auto="true">go</normalised> well attended that he might not
<normalised orig="receave" auto="true">receive</normalised> an affront from ye <normalised orig="Black-Rodde" auto="true">blackguard</normalised> whom they understood was in ye
Court of Requests armed with an order from ye House of Lords to rescue
the Prisoners.  AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.18

This order of the House of Commons was very briskly executed the said
persons being taken from ye <normalised orig="severall" auto="true">several</normalised> <normalised orig="Barrs" auto="true">Bars</normalised> of ye Chancery, King's bench
and Common Pleas, and brought safe into ye Speakers Chamber without
opposition.  AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.19

But ye House of Lords being informed of these proceedings they immediately
order their Black <normalised orig="Rodde" auto="true">Rod</normalised> to fetch out ye <normalised orig="sayd" auto="true">said</normalised> prisoners wherever they
should find them committed; AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.20

they likewise order their black Rod to apprehend ye Sergeant of ye House
of Commons, AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.21

and <normalised orig="addresse" auto="true">address</normalised> to his <normalised orig="Ma=tie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> by word of ye white-staves that
another Sergeant might be <normalised orig="appoynted" auto="true">appointed</normalised> to attend ye House of <normalised orig="Com=ns=" auto="true">Comics</normalised>.
AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.22

The House of <normalised orig="Com=ns=" auto="true">Comics</normalised> after a long debate vote the said persons to be
sent to ye Tower AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.23

and Sir John Robinson <normalised orig="Ser=t=" auto="true">Surety</normalised> of ye Tower being then in ye House had
directions not to <normalised orig="sett" auto="true">set</normalised> them at liberty without an order from ye House.
AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.24

By this time it was <normalised orig="twoe" auto="true">two</normalised> of ye clock AUNGIER-E3-H,25,P.25

and ye House of Lords <P_26,P> had adjourned for an hour or two whose
example in <normalised orig="yt" auto="true">it</normalised> particular ye House of Commons thought <normalised orig="fitt" auto="true">fit</normalised> to follow,
AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.26

And while ye Speaker was at dinner the Sergeant hired three coaches
at Westminster Hall Gate pretending to <normalised orig="carrye" auto="true">carry</normalised> his prisoners through ye
<normalised orig="Citty" auto="true">City</normalised> to ye tower, being then informed that ye black rod lay in <normalised orig="waite" auto="true">wait</normalised>
for him in a house <normalised orig="neare" auto="true">near</normalised> ye <normalised orig="Pallace" auto="true">Palace</normalised> Yard gate, AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.27

But he went discreetlyer to <normalised orig="worke" auto="true">work</normalised>, AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.28

for he <normalised orig="carryed" auto="true">carried</normalised> his prisoners through Sir John Cotton's house
AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.29

and <normalised orig="tooke" auto="true">took</normalised> <normalised orig="bote" auto="true">boat</normalised> at his garden stairs AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.30

and by water delivered them safe into Sir John <normalised orig="Robinson's" auto="true">Refinishing</normalised> hands,
to whom in three minutes the black-rod came to demand the Prisoners,
AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.31

but the <normalised orig="Lieut" auto="true">Lieutenant</normalised>. positively refused to deliver them.
AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.32

As <normalised orig="soone" auto="true">soon</normalised> as the House <normalised orig="mett" auto="true">met</normalised> they agreed upon the enclosed Reasons in
<normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> to ye Paper delivered ye day before by ye Lords at a Conference
AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.33

and sent up a message for a Conference on ye subject matter of ye late
Conference, to <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised> ye Lords <normalised orig="replyed" auto="true">replied</normalised> that they would send up an <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised>
by messengers of their <normalised orig="owne" auto="true">own</normalised>.  AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.34

But their black <normalised orig="rodd" auto="true">rod</normalised> being returned from ye tower and giving them an <normalised orig="acct" auto="true">act</normalised>
that ye <normalised orig="Lieu=t=" auto="true">Levity</normalised> of ye tower refused to deliver ye Prisoners, they voted
a second <normalised orig="addresse" auto="true">address</normalised> to his <normalised orig="Ma=tie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> by ye white-staves that ye <normalised orig="Lieu=tnt=" auto="true">Lieutenant</normalised>
of ye tower should be removed and a new one <normalised orig="appoynted" auto="true">appointed</normalised> in his stead;
to <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised> his <normalised orig="Ma=tie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> then answered that he would consider of it and give
them an <normalised orig="answere" auto="true">answer</normalised> this day by 5 in ye <normalised orig="afternoone" auto="true">afternoon</normalised>.  AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.35

When the House of Commons met this morning, they found their <normalised orig="Sergent" auto="true">Sergeant</normalised>
was changed, AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.36

and while they were debating on it with some warmth Mr Secretary Coventry
came in AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.37

and from his <normalised orig="Ma=tie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> told us that it was his <normalised orig="Ma=ties=" auto="true">Mattes</normalised> pleasure wee should
immediately <normalised orig="adjourne" auto="true">adjourn</normalised> till 4 of ye clock in ye afternoon, when it was
his pleasure we should attend him in ye <normalised orig="bankquetting" auto="true">banqueting</normalised> House, and that
his <normalised orig="Ma=tie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> had sent the same message to ye Lords.  AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.38

Accordingly we <normalised orig="mett" auto="true">met</normalised> when his <normalised orig="Mat=ie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> made us ye enclosed gracious
speech after <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised> the Speaker returning to ye House we voted ye enclosed
votes and adjourned ye debate of our Sergeant till <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised> morning.
AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.39

The Lords after <normalised orig="mett" auto="true">met</normalised> AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.40

and the white-staves reporting to their lordships that his <normalised orig="Mat=ie=" auto="true">Matthew</normalised> had
considered of their <normalised orig="addresse" auto="true">address</normalised> concerning ye removal of ye <normalised orig="Lieu=t=" auto="true">Levity</normalised> of ye
tower, but <normalised orig="sawe" auto="true">saw</normalised> no reason for it.  Upon <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised> their <normalised orig="Lord=sps=" auto="true">Lordships</normalised> adjourned
till <normalised orig="Munday" auto="true">Monday</normalised>.  AUNGIER-E3-H,26,P.41

My paper only now <P_27,P> <normalised orig="allowes" auto="true">allows</normalised> <normalised orig="mee" auto="true">me</normalised> <normalised orig="roome" auto="true">room</normalised> to beg your <normalised orig="Exc=eyes=" auto="true">Excess</normalised>
pardon for this tedious narrative <normalised orig="wch" auto="true">which</normalised> is ye true state of matters of
fact <normalised orig="betweene" auto="true">between</normalised> both Houses.  AUNGIER-E3-H,27,P.42

I am my Lord <normalised orig="Yr" auto="true">Ire</normalised> <normalised orig="Excy=s=" auto="true">Excess</normalised> most humble servant <normalised orig="Fran" auto="true">Frame</normalised> <normalised orig="Aungier" auto="true">Hunger</normalised>
